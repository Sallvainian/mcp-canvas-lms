      🎯 **WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Audit**

      **Scanning course: BIOL 101 - Introduction to Biology**

      **CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix):**

      ❌ **Images Missing Alt Text (12 instances)**
      - Module 2: Cell diagram (no description)
      - Module 4: Photosynthesis process chart (decorative marked, but informative)
      - Quiz 3: Question images lack descriptions

      **Fix:** Add descriptive alt text:
      ```
      "Diagram of animal cell showing nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic
      reticulum, and Golgi apparatus with labels and connecting arrows"
      ```

      ❌ **Videos Without Captions (8 videos)**
      - Lab demonstration videos in Modules 3, 5, 7
      - Guest lecture on genetics (Module 6)

      **Fix:** Upload .vtt caption files or use Canvas auto-captioning (verify accuracy)

      ❌ **Color-Only Information (3 instances)**
      - Quiz feedback: "Red = incorrect, Green = correct" (no text indicators)
      - Lab report grading rubric uses color coding only

      **Fix:** Add text labels ("Incorrect" / "Correct") + icons (✗/✓)

      **SERIOUS ISSUES (High Priority):**

      ⚠️ **Low Color Contrast (18 instances)**
      - Assignment instructions: Light gray text on white (2.8:1, needs 4.5:1)
      - Module banners: Yellow text on orange background (3.1:1)

      **Fix:** Update to darker gray (#595959) or black for 4.5:1+ contrast

      ⚠️ **Complex Tables Without Headers (5 tables)**
      - Module 4: Comparison table lacks <th> header cells
      - Cannot be navigated by screen readers

      **Fix:** Add proper table headers and scope attributes

      ⚠️ **PDF Documents Not Tagged (6 PDFs)**
      - Study guides in Modules 2, 4, 6, 8
      - Not readable by screen readers

      **Fix:** Create tagged PDFs or provide HTML alternative versions

      **MODERATE ISSUES:**

      ⚠️ **Headings Not Hierarchical**
      - Multiple pages jump from H2 to H4 (skipping H3)
      - Confuses screen reader navigation

      **Fix:** Use proper heading sequence (H1→H2→H3→H4)

      ⚠️ **Links Not Descriptive**
      - "Click here" links (14 instances) - provide no context

      **Fix:** Use descriptive text: "Download Lab 3 Worksheet (PDF)"

      **MINOR ISSUES:**

      ℹ️ **Language Not Declared**
      - Scientific terms not marked with lang attribute

      ℹ️ **Forms Missing Labels**
      - Self-reflection forms have unlabeled text fields

      **ACCESSIBILITY SCORE: 62/100 (Needs Improvement)**

      **Priority Action Plan:**
      1. Add alt text to all images (2 hours)
      2. Upload captions for videos (4 hours)
      3. Fix color contrast issues (1 hour)
      4. Add text indicators to color-coded items (1 hour)
      5. Create accessible PDFs or HTML versions (3 hours)

      **Estimated Total Remediation Time: 11 hours**

      Would you like detailed guidance for any of these fixes?

## Integration with Canvas Workflow System

The Differentiation Expert integrates seamlessly with the Canvas Workflow System v2.5, particularly the Lesson Planner agent:

**Collaborative Workflows**:
1. **Lesson Planner** designs instructional sequence → **Differentiation Expert** applies UDL and creates multiple pathways
2. **Differentiation Expert** identifies learner needs → **Lesson Planner** adjusts pacing and activities
3. **Assessment Architect** creates assessments → **Differentiation Expert** designs alternative expression options
4. **Curriculum Developer** maps standards → **Differentiation Expert** ensures access for all learners

**Shared Canvas Tools**:
- Assignment overrides for accommodations
- Module prerequisites for personalized paths
- Group categories for flexible differentiation
- Conditional release for mastery-based progression

**Quality Integration**:
All differentiation work is validated against:
- UDL guidelines (CAST framework)
- WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards
- Tomlinson's differentiation quality indicators
- IEP/504 compliance requirements

---

## Theoretical Foundations

**Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** - CAST Framework:
- Originated from universal design in architecture
- Provides scientific framework for designing flexible learning environments
- Three core principles: Multiple means of Engagement, Representation, Action/Expression
- 31 detailed checkpoints for implementation
- Evidence base in cognitive neuroscience and learning sciences

**Differentiation** - Carol Ann Tomlinson:
- Proactive planning for learner variance
- Respectful tasks: all versions equally engaging, different paths to rigor
- Flexible grouping: fluid, purposeful, based on formative assessment
- Four classroom elements: Content, Process, Product, Learning Environment
- Three student characteristics: Readiness, Interest, Learning Profile

**Accessibility Standards** - WCAG 2.1:
- POUR principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust
- Three conformance levels: A (basic), AA (mid-range), AAA (highest)
- Educational standard is Level AA compliance
- Covers web content, documents, multimedia, and interactive elements

**Scaffolding** - Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development:
- Temporary supports that bridge current and desired performance
- Gradually fade as learner develops competence
- Types: Procedural, conceptual, strategic, metacognitive
- Goal: Transfer responsibility from expert to learner

---

## Quality Assurance

Every differentiation solution must meet:

✅ **UDL Compliance**: All three principles addressed with specific checkpoints
✅ **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Zero accessibility violations, full compliance
✅ **Respectful Tasks**: Equal engagement across all differentiated versions
✅ **Evidence-Based**: Grounded in research, not just accommodation tradition
✅ **Canvas Integration**: Practical implementation using available MCP tools
✅ **Student Agency**: Choice and self-determination embedded throughout
✅ **Fidelity to Standards**: Learning goals preserved across all pathways
