```

**Theoretical Foundation - Hattie's Feedback Model**:

**Four Feedback Levels** (in order of effectiveness):
1. **Self-Regulation** (most effective): Helps students self-assess and self-correct
2. **Process**: Addresses strategies and processes used
3. **Task**: Corrects errors or provides more information
4. **Self** (least effective): Praise without specific guidance

**Three Feedback Questions**:
- **Feed Up**: Where am I going? (goals/success criteria)
- **Feed Back**: How am I going? (current progress)
- **Feed Forward**: Where to next? (improvement strategies)

**Workflow**:

1. **Feed Up - Clarify Goals**
   ```yaml
   Establish Clear Targets:
     - Share rubrics before assignment
     - Provide exemplars and non-exemplars
     - Co-create success criteria with students
     - Make learning progressions visible

   Canvas Implementation:
     - Attach rubric to assignment

       chronologically to strengthen the argument flow"

     - Self-regulation: "Before submitting next time,
       read your essay aloud and check each paragraph
       has a clear topic sentence"

     - Specific actions: "Revise paragraph 3 by adding
       one piece of evidence with analysis. See exemplar
       for model."

## Assessment Frameworks & Research Foundation

### Formative vs. Summative Assessment

**Black & Wiliam's Formative Assessment Framework**:
```yaml
Core Principle:
  "Assessment FOR learning, not just OF learning"

Five Key Strategies:
  1. Clarify learning intentions and success criteria
     - Students know where they're going
     - Success is visible and achievable

  2. Engineer discussions and tasks that elicit evidence
     - Questions reveal student thinking
     - Tasks designed to surface understanding

  3. Provide feedback that moves learning forward
     - Actionable, specific, timely
     - Focused on process and self-regulation

  4. Activate students as learning resources for each other
     - Peer assessment and feedback
     - Collaborative learning structures

  5. Activate students as owners of their learning
     - Self-assessment and reflection
     - Goal-setting and progress monitoring

Implementation:
  - Formative: Ungraded, frequent, immediate feedback
  - Summative: Graded, periodic, demonstrates mastery
  - Balance: 3-5 formative per 1 summative
```

### Assessment Validity & Reliability

**Validity Types**:
```yaml
Content Validity:
  - Assessment covers representative sample of content
  - Items aligned with standards and objectives
  - Appropriate difficulty and cognitive level

Construct Validity:
  - Measures the intended learning construct
  - Free from construct-irrelevant factors
  - Demonstrates expected relationships with other measures

Face Validity:
  - Appears to measure what it claims
  - Makes sense to students and stakeholders
  - Clear connection to learning goals

Consequential Validity:
  - Assessment consequences are fair and beneficial
  - Results lead to appropriate instructional decisions
  - No negative impact on student learning or equity
```

**Reliability Considerations**:
```yaml
Internal Consistency:
  - Items measure same construct coherently
  - Cronbach's alpha for multi-item assessments
  - Remove items that don't fit

Inter-Rater Reliability:
  - Multiple raters produce consistent scores
  - Rubric clarity and shared understanding
  - Calibration and moderation processes

Test-Retest Reliability:
  - Consistent results across administrations
  - Appropriate for summative assessments
  - Control for learning effects
```

### Rubric Design Methodologies

**Analytic Rubrics**:
```yaml
Structure:
  - Separate score for each criterion
  - Detailed performance descriptors
  - Independent evaluation of components

Best For:
  - Complex tasks with multiple components
  - Diagnostic feedback needs
  - Skill development tracking

Advantages:
  - Detailed, specific feedback
  - Clear strengths and growth areas
  - Supports targeted instruction

Example Application:
  Research Paper Assessment:
    - Thesis and Argument (25%)
    - Evidence and Support (25%)
    - Organization and Structure (20%)
    - Language and Mechanics (15%)
    - Citation and Format (15%)
```

**Holistic Rubrics**:
```yaml
Structure:
  - Single overall score
  - Integrated performance description
  - General impression of quality

Best For:
  - Quick scoring needs
  - Global judgment appropriate (essays, presentations)
  - High-stakes standardized contexts

Advantages:
  - Efficient scoring
  - Considers total impact
  - Prevents micro-analysis

Limitations:
  - Less specific feedback
  - Harder to target instruction
  - Potential for bias
```

**Single-Point Rubrics** (Fluckiger):
```yaml
Structure:
  - Central column: Proficient expectations
  - Left column: Areas for growth
  - Right column: Evidence of exceeding

Best For:
  - Streamlined feedback
  - Student agency and voice
  - Growth mindset emphasis

Advantages:
  - Focuses on individual growth
  - Less restrictive than traditional rubrics
  - Easier to personalize feedback
  - Reduces time scoring

Example:
  Proficient: "Uses 3-4 relevant sources with analysis"
  Growth: [Space for specific areas to develop]
  Exceeding: [Space to note exceptional elements]
```

### Hattie's Feedback Research

**Feedback Effectiveness Hierarchy**:
```yaml
Most Effective (d=.95):
  Self-Regulation Level:
    "How can you check your own work?"
    "What strategies will you use next time?"
    "Set a goal based on this feedback"

Highly Effective (d=.70):
