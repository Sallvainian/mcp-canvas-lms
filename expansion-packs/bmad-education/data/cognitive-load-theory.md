# Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)

## Overview
Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) explains how the limitations of working memory affect learning. By understanding these constraints, educators can design instruction that optimizes cognitive load, making learning more efficient and effective. CLT provides practical strategies for managing the amount and type of mental effort required during learning.

## Theoretical Foundation
**Developed by**: John Sweller (1988, 1994, 2011)
**Research Base**: Cognitive psychology, information processing theory, evolutionary psychology

**Key Assumptions**:
1. Working memory is limited (7±2 items for ~20 seconds)
2. Long-term memory is virtually unlimited
3. Schemas (organized knowledge structures) reduce cognitive load
4. Expertise = extensive, organized schemas in long-term memory

## Types of Cognitive Load

### 1. Intrinsic Load
**Definition**: The inherent difficulty of the material based on element interactivity

**Element Interactivity**: How many elements must be processed simultaneously to understand the material

**Examples**:
```yaml
Low Intrinsic Load (Low Element Interactivity):
  - Learning individual vocabulary words
  - Memorizing multiplication facts
  - Identifying parts of a cell
  # Elements can be learned independently

High Intrinsic Load (High Element Interactivity):
  - Solving complex equations (multiple steps interact)
  - Writing persuasive essays (many components must coordinate)
  - Understanding ecosystems (multiple interacting variables)
  # Elements must be processed together to understand
```

**Managing Intrinsic Load**:
- **Cannot eliminate** (it's inherent to the material)
- **Can manage** through sequencing and simplification

**Strategies**:

**Part-Task Training**: Break complex skills into components
```yaml
Complex Skill: Writing research paper

Sequential Components:
  1. Finding sources (alone)
  2. Evaluating sources (alone)
  3. Taking notes (alone)
  4. Organizing information (alone)
  5. Writing with citations (combining all)
  
# Reduce load by mastering components before integration
```

**Simple-to-Complex Sequencing**: Build gradually
```yaml
Math Example: Solving equations

Sequence:
  1. One-step equations: x + 5 = 12
  2. Two-step equations: 2x + 5 = 12
  3. Multi-step equations: 2(x + 5) = 12
  4. Equations with variables on both sides: 2x + 5 = x + 12
  
# Each step adds minimal new complexity
```

**Prerequisite Mastery**: Ensure foundational knowledge is secure
```yaml
Before Teaching: Photosynthesis (high intrinsic load)

Ensure Mastery of Prerequisites:
  - Cell structure (especially chloroplasts)
  - Basic chemistry (atoms, molecules)
  - Energy concepts
  
# Prerequisite knowledge becomes automatic, freeing working memory
```

### 2. Extraneous Load
**Definition**: Unnecessary cognitive load imposed by poor instructional design

**Causes**: Poorly designed materials, confusing presentation, irrelevant information

**Managing Extraneous Load**:
- **Goal**: Minimize or eliminate
- **Strategy**: Improve instructional design

**CLT Instructional Principles**:

**Worked Example Effect**
Study completed examples rather than practicing problems
```yaml
Traditional (High Extraneous Load):
  Give students 20 practice problems immediately

CLT-Informed (Reduced Extraneous Load):
  1. Study 3 worked examples
  2. Attempt similar problems
  3. Gradually fade worked examples
  
Research: 50% reduction in time to mastery
```

**Split-Attention Effect**
Integrate text and diagrams; avoid separation
```yaml
Poor Design (Split Attention):
  Diagram at top of page
  Explanation at bottom
  Student must hold diagram in mind while reading
  
Better Design (Integrated):
  Labels and brief explanations ON the diagram
  No need to split attention between sources
```

**Redundancy Effect**
Avoid presenting same information in multiple forms simultaneously
```yaml
Poor Design (Redundant):
  Diagram with labels +
  Identical text description +
  Narration reading same text
  # Working memory processes all three unnecessarily
  
Better Design (Non-redundant):
  Diagram with labels +
  Narration explaining (not reading text)
  OR
  Diagram + text (for self-paced learning)
  # One verbal channel input
```

**Modality Effect**
Use both visual and auditory channels effectively
```yaml
Poor Design (Visual Overload):
  Diagram + lengthy text labels + written explanation
  # All visual channel - overload
  
Better Design (Dual Channel):
  Diagram + brief labels (visual)
  Narration explaining process (auditory)
  # Distributes load across channels
```

**Coherence Principle**
Exclude interesting but irrelevant information
```yaml
Poor Design (Seductive Details):
  Lesson on photosynthesis includes:
  - Fun facts about unusual plants
  - History of botanical gardens
  - Stories about botanists
  # Interesting but distracts from core learning

Better Design (Coherent):
  Focus solely on photosynthesis process
  Exclude tangential information
  # All content supports learning objective
```

**Signaling Principle**
Highlight essential information
```yaml
Strategies:
  - Bold key terms
  - Use headings and subheadings
  - Add arrows or highlighting to diagrams
  - Explicitly state "The main point is..."
  - Use color strategically (not decoratively)
```

**Segmenting Principle**
Present complex material in learner-controlled segments
```yaml
Poor Design (Continuous):
  20-minute uninterrupted video lecture

Better Design (Segmented):
  Video broken into 3-5 minute segments
  Student controls pace with pause/review
  Short quiz or reflection between segments
```

**Pre-training Principle**
Teach key concepts and terminology first
```yaml
Before Complex Lesson:
  Pre-teach:
  - Key vocabulary with definitions
  - Basic component identification
  - Simple relationships
  
Then: Teach complex interactions
# Familiar terms reduce load during main instruction
```

### 3. Germane Load
**Definition**: Cognitive load devoted to schema construction and automation

**Goal**: Maximize germane load (productive mental effort)

**Characteristics**:
- Promotes learning and understanding
- Builds schemas and mental models
- Develops expertise

**Promoting Germane Load**:

**Self-Explanation Prompts**
Encourage students to explain their reasoning
```yaml
Problem Solving with Prompts:
  
  After each step, student answers:
  - "Why did I do this step?"
  - "How does this connect to previous steps?"
  - "What principle applies here?"
  
  Effect: Deeper processing, better schemas
```

**Varied Examples**
Present multiple examples showing different applications
```yaml
Teaching Concept: Erosion

Examples:
  - River cutting through rock
  - Wind shaping sand dunes
  - Ocean waves on coastline
  - Glacier movement
  
Students extract common principle from varied contexts
```

**Comparison and Contrast**
Present related concepts together to highlight similarities and differences
```yaml
Biology: Compare/Contrast
  - Mitosis vs. Meiosis
  - Photosynthesis vs. Respiration
  - DNA vs. RNA
  
Promotes schema development through relationship building
```

**Analogies and Metaphors**
Connect new information to existing knowledge
```yaml
New Concept: Electric current

Analogy: Water flowing through pipes
  - Voltage = water pressure
  - Current = flow rate
  - Resistance = pipe diameter
  
Builds on existing water schema to understand electricity
```

## Expertise Reversal Effect

**Definition**: Instructional techniques effective for novices can be ineffective or harmful for experts

**Explanation**:
- Novices benefit from worked examples, high guidance
- Experts have extensive schemas; extra guidance is redundant
- What was helpful becomes extraneous as expertise develops

**Implications**:
```yaml
Novice Learners:
  - Need: Worked examples, step-by-step guidance
  - Avoid: Problem solving without support
  
Intermediate Learners:
  - Need: Fading guidance, partial examples
  - Avoid: Full worked examples (redundant)
  
Expert Learners:
  - Need: Complex problems, minimal guidance
  - Avoid: Step-by-step instructions (extraneous)
```

**Example**:
```yaml
Learning to Solve Quadratic Equations

Novice:
  Provide: Complete worked examples with each step explained
  
Intermediate:
  Provide: Partial worked examples (student fills in steps)
  
Advanced:
  Provide: Problem only (no scaffolding)
  
# Same instruction doesn't fit all expertise levels
```

## Practical Applications

### Instructional Design Guidelines

**Reducing Extraneous Load**:
1. Eliminate decorative graphics and irrelevant text
2. Integrate text and visuals spatially and temporally
3. Remove redundant presentations (don't read text on slide)
4. Use dual channels (visual + auditory) appropriately
5. Segment complex content into manageable chunks

**Managing Intrinsic Load**:
1. Sequence from simple to complex
2. Ensure prerequisite knowledge is solid
3. Use part-task training for complex skills
4. Teach components before requiring integration

**Optimizing Germane Load**:
1. Use varied examples to build flexible schemas
2. Prompt self-explanation and reflection
3. Encourage schema construction through comparison
4. Build from concrete to abstract

### Lesson Planning with CLT

**Step 1: Analyze Load**
```yaml
Consider:
  - Intrinsic load: How complex is the material?
  - Student expertise: Novice, intermediate, advanced?
  - Prerequisite knowledge: Is it solid?
  
Decisions:
  - High intrinsic load + novice = Need extra support
  - Low intrinsic load + advanced = Challenge with complexity
```

**Step 2: Reduce Extraneous Load**
```yaml
Materials Design:
  - Simplify slides (minimal text, integrated visuals)
  - Remove decorative elements
  - Use clear, simple language
  - Organize logically with signaling
```

**Step 3: Manage Intrinsic Load**
```yaml
Sequencing:
  1. Pre-teach vocabulary and concepts
  2. Start with simple examples
  3. Build to complex applications
  4. Ensure practice at each level before advancing
```

**Step 4: Optimize Germane Load**
```yaml
Active Learning:
  - Prompt explanations
  - Compare examples
  - Apply to new contexts
  - Create concept maps
```

## Canvas Integration

### CLT-Informed Course Design

**Module Structure** (Segmenting Principle):
```yaml
canvas_create_module:
  name: "Week 3: Ecosystems"
  # Break into bite-sized, sequential segments
  
  items:
    - "Pre-Learning: Key Vocabulary (5 min)"
    - "Concept 1: Producers (8 min video + quiz)"

canvas_create_page:
  title: "How to Solve Genetics Problems"
  body: |
    ## Worked Example 1: Simple Monohybrid Cross
    [Step-by-step solution with explanation of each step]
    
    ## Guided Practice 1
    [Similar problem with partial solution - student completes]
    
    ## Worked Example 2: Dihybrid Cross
    [Step-by-step solution]
    
    ## Guided Practice 2
    [Partial solution]
    
    ## Your Turn: Independent Practice
    [Problems without scaffolding]
    
    # Gradual fading of support as expertise develops
```

**Integrated Instruction** (Split-Attention Reduction):
```yaml
canvas_create_assignment:
  name: "Cell Processes Tutorial"
  description: |
    Watch video tutorial with narration explaining diagram.
    
    Design: Diagram on screen + narration (integrated)
    
    Avoid: Diagram + separate text + narration (redundant)
    
    After video, complete guided notes (reinforcement).
```

**Pre-training** (Pre-training Principle):
```yaml
canvas_create_module:
  name: "Unit 4: Chemical Reactions"
  
  items:
    # Pre-training (reduces load in main lesson)
    - "Required: Key Chemistry Vocabulary Quiz"
    - "Required: Review - Atoms and Molecules"
    - "Required: Balancing Equations Basics"
    
    # Main instruction (builds on secure foundation)
    - "Types of Chemical Reactions"
    - "Predicting Products"
    - "Real-World Applications"
```

**Expertise-Adaptive Paths** (Expertise Reversal):
```yaml
canvas_create_assignment:
  name: "Stoichiometry Practice - Choose Your Level"
  description: |
    Take 5-question diagnostic. Based on results:
    
    **Novice Path** (0-2 correct):
    - Worked examples with detailed explanations
    - Step-by-step guided practice
    - Immediate feedback
    
    **Intermediate Path** (3-4 correct):
    - Partial worked examples
    - Hints available if needed
    - Practice with variety
    
    **Advanced Path** (5 correct):
    - Complex problems
    - Minimal scaffolding
    - Real-world applications
```

**Coherence in Design** (Coherence Principle):
```yaml
canvas_create_page:
  title: "Newton's Laws of Motion"
  body: |
    ## Focus: Three Laws and Applications
    
    Content includes:
    - Clear statement of each law
    - Simple examples of each
    - Practice problems
    
    Excluded (despite being interesting):
    - Biography of Newton
    - History of physics
    - Other scientists' contributions
    
    # All content directly supports learning laws
```

## Cognitive Load and Assessment

**Reducing Load During Tests**:
- Provide formula sheets (don't require memorization during problem-solving)
- Allow aids for complex terminology
- Focus on understanding, not recall
- Use familiar formats

**Example**:
```yaml
canvas_create_quiz:
  title: "Physics Problem Solving"
  description: |
    Formula sheet provided - focus is on application, not memorization.
    
    Calculator allowed - focus is on setup, not arithmetic.
    
    Clear diagrams - no need to visualize from text alone.
    
    # Minimize extraneous load so working memory available for problem-solving
```

## Common Instructional Mistakes (CLT Perspective)

**Mistake 1: Overuse of Discovery Learning for Novices**
```yaml
Problem: Novices lack schemas for productive exploration
Solution: Provide worked examples first, then discovery

Not: "Figure out how to solve quadratic equations"
Better: Study worked examples, then apply to new problems
```

**Mistake 2: Decorative Graphics and Irrelevant Details**
```yaml
Problem: Increases extraneous load
Solution: Remove anything not supporting learning

Not: Slides with decorative clipart, background images
Better: Simple, clean slides with essential visuals only
```

**Mistake 3: Reading Text on Slides**
```yaml
Problem: Redundancy effect - visual and auditory presenting same text
Solution: Speak about visuals, don't read text

Not: Slide with paragraph + reading paragraph aloud
Better: Slide with image/diagram + explaining verbally
```

**Mistake 4: Too Much at Once**
```yaml
Problem: Exceeds working memory capacity
Solution: Segment into manageable chunks

Not: 60-minute lecture on complex topic
Better: 4 x 15-minute segments with activities between
```
