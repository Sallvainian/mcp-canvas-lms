# Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Framework

## Overview
The Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework provides a blueprint for creating flexible learning experiences that accommodate individual learning differences. Based on neuroscience research, UDL guides the design of learning environments that are accessible and challenging for all learners.

## Theoretical Foundation
**Developed by**: CAST (Center for Applied Special Technology)
**Current Version**: UDL Guidelines 3.0 (2024)
**Research Base**: Neuroscience, cognitive psychology, educational research

**Core Premise**: Variability is the norm, not the exception. Effective learning environments must be designed from the start to address diverse learner needs.

**Brain Networks**:
- **Recognition Networks**: The "what" of learning (perceiving and processing information)
- **Strategic Networks**: The "how" of learning (planning and executing tasks)
- **Affective Networks**: The "why" of learning (engaging and motivating)
