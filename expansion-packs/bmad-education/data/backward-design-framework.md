# Understanding by Design (UbD) - Backward Design Framework

## Overview

Understanding by Design (UbD) is a curriculum planning framework developed by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe (1998, revised 2005). The framework emphasizes "backward design" - starting with desired learning outcomes and working backward to develop curriculum, instruction, and assessment.

**Core Philosophy**: Traditional curriculum design often starts with favorite activities or textbook chapters. UbD starts with the end in mind: What should students understand and be able to do?

## Core Principles

### The Three Stages (Backward Design)

**Stage 1: Identify Desired Results**
- What should students know, understand, and be able to do?
- What enduring understandings are desired?
- What essential questions will guide inquiry?

**Stage 2: Determine Acceptable Evidence**
- How will we know if students have achieved desired results?
- What will count as evidence of understanding and proficiency?
- What assessment tasks will reveal understanding?

**Stage 3: Plan Learning Experiences and Instruction**
- What activities will equip students with needed knowledge and skills?
- What will need to be taught and how should it best be taught?
- What materials and resources are needed?

### Six Facets of Understanding

Students truly understand when they can:

1. **Explain**: Provide thorough, supported accounts of phenomena, facts, and data
2. **Interpret**: Tell meaningful stories, offer apt translations, provide revealing insights
3. **Apply**: Use knowledge effectively in new situations and diverse contexts
4. **Have Perspective**: See and hear points of view through critical eyes and ears
5. **Empathize**: Find value in what others might find odd, alien, or implausible
6. **Have Self-Knowledge**: Perceive the personal style, prejudices, projections, and habits that shape understanding

## Detailed Framework

### Stage 1: Identify Desired Results

#### Step 1A: Establish Goals
Identify established goals (standards, curriculum expectations, learning outcomes)

**Questions to Ask**:
- What relevant goals (e.g., content standards, program objectives) will this design address?
- What should students know and be able to do as a result of this unit?

**Example (High School Biology)**:
```
Standard: HS-LS1-2
Develop and use a model to illustrate the hierarchical organization of interacting systems that provide specific functions within multicellular organisms.

Goals:
- Students will understand cell structure and function
- Students will understand how cells organize into tissues, organs, and systems
- Students will apply systems thinking to biological organization
```

#### Step 1B: Determine Enduring Understandings

**Enduring Understandings**: The big ideas that have lasting value beyond the classroom

**Characteristics**:
- Broad, important ideas that have lasting value
- Transfer to new situations
- Reside at the heart of the discipline
- Require uncoverage (not obvious, counter-intuitive, or easily misunderstood)

**Template**: "Students will understand that..."

**Example (Biology)**:
```
Students will understand that:
- Structure determines function at all levels of biological organization
- Living systems are organized hierarchically, with emergent properties at each level
- Systems thinking helps us understand complex biological interactions
- Multicellular organisms require specialization and coordination
```

**Poor vs. Strong Examples**:
❌ **Poor**: "Students will understand the cell"
- Too vague, not transferable, no insight

✅ **Strong**: "Students will understand that structure determines function at all levels of biological organization"
- Transferable, big idea, requires deep thinking

#### Step 1C: Frame Essential Questions

**Essential Questions**: Provocative, open-ended questions that stimulate thought and inquiry

**Characteristics**:
- Open-ended (no single, final answer)
- Thought-provoking (higher-order thinking required)
- Important (addresses core ideas)
- Recurring (revisited over time)
- Frames meaningful work

**Types of Essential Questions**:

**Overarching** (transcends subject):
- "How do we know what we know?"
- "What is the relationship between structure and function?"

**Topical** (specific to unit):
- "How does cellular organization enable life?"
- "Why do multicellular organisms need specialized cells?"

**Example (Biology)**:
```
Overarching:
- How does structure relate to function?
- What is a system and how do systems work?

Topical:
- How does the organization of cells into systems sustain life?
- What happens when biological systems break down?
- How do parts work together to create something greater than themselves?
```

**Poor vs. Strong Examples**:
❌ **Poor**: "What are the parts of a cell?"
- Closed-ended, factual recall only

✅ **Strong**: "How does cellular organization enable life?"
- Open-ended, requires synthesis, guides inquiry

#### Step 1D: Identify Key Knowledge and Skills

**Knowledge**: Facts, concepts, principles students should know
**Skills**: What students should be able to do

**Knowledge (Students will know...)**:
- Cell structures and functions
- Levels of organization (cell → tissue → organ → system)
- Characteristics of different tissue types
- Major organ systems and functions

**Skills (Students will be able to...)**:
- Identify cellular structures
- Explain structure-function relationships
- Analyze hierarchical organization
- Apply systems thinking to biological problems

### Stage 2: Determine Acceptable Evidence

#### Step 2A: Performance Tasks

**Performance Tasks**: Complex, authentic assessments requiring transfer of understanding

**GRASPS Framework** for designing authentic tasks:

**G - Goal**: What is the challenge or problem to solve?
**R - Role**: What is the student's role?
**A - Audience**: Who is the target audience?
**S - Situation**: What is the context or scenario?
**P - Product/Performance**: What will students create or do?
**S - Standards**: What are the criteria for success?

**Example (Biology Performance Task)**:
```
G: Design a public health campaign about a disease affecting an organ system
R: You are a public health educator
A: Community members at risk for the disease
S: There's an outbreak of diabetes in your community
P: Create an educational presentation explaining:
   - How diabetes affects the endocrine and circulatory systems
   - The relationship between system breakdown and symptoms
   - Prevention and management strategies
S: Rubric includes:
   - Accuracy of biological content
   - Clear explanation of systems interactions
   - Effective communication to non-experts
   - Evidence-based recommendations
```

#### Step 2B: Other Evidence

**Additional Assessments**:
- Quizzes and tests
- Observations and checks
- Student self-assessment
- Informal checks for understanding

**Example (Biology)**:
```
Formative Assessments:
- Weekly quizzes on cell structures and functions
- Lab observations of microscope skills
- Exit tickets: "Explain one structure-function relationship"
- Concept maps showing organizational hierarchy

Summative Assessments:
- Unit test on cellular organization
- Lab practical: Identify tissues and explain functions
- Portfolio of structure-function analyses
```

#### Step 2C: Assessment Evidence Summary

Create an evidence plan showing when and how understanding will be assessed:

| Assessment | Type | Format | When | Addresses |
|------------|------|--------|------|-----------|
| Pre-assessment | Diagnostic | Concept map | Week 1 | Prior knowledge |
| Weekly quizzes | Formative | Selected response | Ongoing | Knowledge/skills |
| Lab observations | Formative | Checklist | Weeks 2-4 | Skills |
| Performance task | Summative | GRASPS | Week 5 | Understanding |
| Unit exam | Summative | Mixed format | Week 6 | All goals |
