# Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK)

## Overview

Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) is a framework developed by Norman Webb (1997) to categorize tasks according to the cognitive complexity required to successfully complete them. Unlike Bloom's Taxonomy which focuses on the type of thinking, DOK focuses on the depth or complexity of thinking required.

**Key Distinction**: DOK is about **complexity**, not **difficulty**. A difficult Level 1 task is still Level 1; a complex task requiring extended thinking is Level 4 regardless of difficulty.

## Core Principles

1. **Complexity Over Difficulty**: Focus on cognitive demand, not task difficulty
2. **Context Matters**: Same verb can represent different DOK levels in different contexts
3. **Not Hierarchical**: Students don't need to "master" lower levels before engaging with higher levels
4. **Transfer of Knowledge**: Higher levels require applying knowledge in new contexts
5. **Extended Thinking**: Level 4 requires sustained cognitive effort over time

## DOK vs. Bloom's Taxonomy

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Bloom's Taxonomy | Webb's DOK |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Focus | Type of thinking | Complexity/Depth of thinking |
| Structure | Hierarchical (must progress through levels) | Non-hierarchical (can start anywhere) |
| Time | Single task/moment in time | Can require extended time |
| Answer | Can have single correct answer at all levels | Higher levels require multiple possibilities |
| Measurement | What students do | How deeply they understand |

### Complementary Use

**Bloom's** asks: *What type of thinking?*
**DOK** asks: *How complex is the thinking?*

**Example: "Compare and Contrast"**

**Bloom's Level**: Analyze (Level 4 of 6)

**DOK Variations**:
- **DOK 1**: Compare two numbers (3 vs 5) → Simple recall of concept
- **DOK 2**: Compare two geometric shapes using properties → Skills and concepts
- **DOK 3**: Compare themes in two stories citing textual evidence → Strategic thinking
- **DOK 4**: Compare historical movements across multiple sources and time periods → Extended thinking

### Integration Framework

Combine both for complete cognitive picture:

| Bloom's | DOK 1 | DOK 2 | DOK 3 | DOK 4 |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Remember | Recall facts | Locate information | - | - |
| Understand | Define terms | Summarize text | Interpret complex text | Synthesize across sources |
| Apply | Follow procedure | Solve 2-step problem | Apply to new context | Design application |
| Analyze | Identify parts | Categorize | Analyze with evidence | Analyze across disciplines |
| Evaluate | - | Compare/contrast | Critique with criteria | Evaluate complex systems |
| Create | - | Construct diagram | Develop argument | Design original project |

## Application Guidelines

### Task Analysis Protocol

**Step 1: Identify the Verb**
- What action is the student asked to perform?
- Remember: Same verb can be different DOK levels

**Step 2: Analyze the Context**
- What cognitive processes are required?
- Is there one answer or multiple possibilities?
- How much prior knowledge is needed?

**Step 3: Consider the Depth**
- How many steps are involved?
- What level of reasoning is required?
- Is extended time needed?

**Step 4: Determine DOK Level**
- Level 1: Recall and reproduction
- Level 2: Skills and concepts
- Level 3: Strategic thinking
- Level 4: Extended thinking

### Example Analysis

**Task**: "Explain photosynthesis"

**Analysis**:
- **Verb**: Explain (can be any DOK level)
- **Context Matters**:

**DOK 1**: "Explain means to state the definition of photosynthesis"
→ Simple recall, one answer, no interpretation

**DOK 2**: "Explain the process of photosynthesis including inputs and outputs"
→ Requires organizing information, showing relationships, multiple components

**DOK 3**: "Explain how photosynthesis and cellular respiration work together in an ecosystem, citing specific evidence"
→ Requires analysis, evidence use, complex relationships

**DOK 4**: "Explain how photosynthesis could be adapted for food production in space, synthesizing research from biology, chemistry, and engineering"
→ Requires extended investigation, synthesis across disciplines, original application

### Vertical Alignment Example

**Topic**: American Civil War (Progression Across Grade Levels)

**Grade 3 (DOK 1-2)**:
- DOK 1: List key events of Civil War
- DOK 2: Compare North and South using graphic organizer

**Grade 5 (DOK 2-3)**:
- DOK 2: Summarize causes of Civil War
- DOK 3: Analyze different perspectives on slavery using primary sources

**Grade 8 (DOK 3-4)**:
- DOK 3: Develop argument about Civil War causes with evidence
- DOK 4: Research local Civil War impact using multiple sources and create documentary

**Grade 11 (DOK 3-4)**:
- DOK 3: Analyze how Civil War shaped modern America
- DOK 4: Synthesize historical research to evaluate long-term constitutional impacts

### Common Misidentifications

**Misconception 1**: "Difficult = Higher DOK"
- ❌ Multiplying 4-digit numbers (difficult but still DOK 1 - procedure recall)
- ✅ DOK level is about complexity of thinking, not difficulty of task

**Misconception 2**: "Keywords Determine DOK"
- ❌ "Analyze" always means DOK 3
- ✅ Context determines level: "Analyze this number (even/odd)" = DOK 1

**Misconception 3**: "More Words = Higher DOK"
- ❌ Long word problem asking for simple calculation = DOK 1
- ✅ Brief task requiring complex reasoning = DOK 3

**Misconception 4**: "Must Progress Through Levels"
- ❌ Students must master DOK 1 before attempting DOK 3
- ✅ Students can engage with DOK 3-4 tasks while building foundational skills
