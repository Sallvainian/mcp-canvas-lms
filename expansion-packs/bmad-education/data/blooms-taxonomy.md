# Bloom's Taxonomy (Revised)

## Overview

Bloom's Taxonomy is a hierarchical classification of cognitive learning objectives developed by Benjamin Bloom (1956) and revised by Anderson and Krathwohl (2001). The revised taxonomy provides a framework for categorizing educational goals, assessments, and standards to ensure alignment across curriculum, instruction, and assessment.

**Key Revision (2001)**: Changed from nouns to verbs to emphasize active learning processes, and moved "Creating" to the highest level.

## Core Principles

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Lower levels provide foundation for higher-order thinking
2. **Cumulative Learning**: Mastery of lower levels supports achievement at higher levels
3. **Instructional Alignment**: Learning objectives, activities, and assessments should align at same level
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Cognitive demand increases from Remember to Create
5. **Universal Application**: Applies across all disciplines and age levels

## Application Guidelines

### Lesson Planning Framework

1. **Identify Learning Level**:
   - What cognitive level is appropriate for student readiness?
   - Where in the curriculum progression are students?
   - What prior knowledge exists?

2. **Write Clear Objectives**:
   - Use appropriate action verbs from target level
   - Make objectives measurable and observable
   - Align with assessment methods

3. **Design Aligned Activities**:
   - Match activities to objective level
   - Scaffold from lower to higher levels
   - Provide practice at target level

4. **Create Aligned Assessments**:
   - Use verbs from same level as objective
   - Match assessment format to cognitive demand
   - Ensure questions require target-level thinking

### Vertical Alignment Example

**Topic**: American Revolution

| Level | Objective | Activity | Assessment |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Remember | List key events of American Revolution | Timeline creation | Quiz: Date matching |
| Understand | Explain causes of Revolution | Cause-effect diagram | Short answer: Explain 3 causes |
| Apply | Apply revolutionary principles to modern context | Case study analysis | Essay: Apply to current event |
| Analyze | Analyze perspectives of different groups | Primary source analysis | Compare/contrast perspectives |
| Evaluate | Evaluate effectiveness of revolutionary tactics | Historical debate | Position paper with evidence |
| Create | Create alternative historical scenario | Counterfactual project | Design alternative outcome |

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Verb Confusion**: Using high-level verb for low-level task
   - ❌ "Analyze the definition of photosynthesis" (just recalling)
   - ✅ "Analyze the relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration"

2. **Assessment Mismatch**: Testing at different level than objective
   - ❌ Objective: Create a solution; Assessment: Multiple choice test
   - ✅ Objective: Create a solution; Assessment: Design project

3. **Skipping Levels**: Jumping to Create without building foundation
   - ❌ Create a novel solution without understanding concepts
   - ✅ Progress through levels: Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze → Evaluate → Create

4. **Activity-Objective Disconnect**: Activity doesn't match cognitive level
   - ❌ Objective: Evaluate; Activity: Copy notes
   - ✅ Objective: Evaluate; Activity: Critique peer work with rubric
