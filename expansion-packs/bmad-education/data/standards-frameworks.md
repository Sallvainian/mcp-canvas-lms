# Educational Standards Frameworks

## Overview

Educational standards frameworks provide the foundation for curriculum development, instruction, and assessment across disciplines. This resource covers major standards frameworks used in K-12 education and their integration with Canvas LMS.

**Purpose**: Standards define what students should know and be able to do at each grade level, ensuring consistency, rigor, and progression across educational systems.

## Core Principles

### Universal Standards Characteristics

1. **Clear and Measurable**: Specific learning expectations that can be assessed
2. **Rigorous and Grade-Appropriate**: Challenging yet developmentally suitable
3. **Coherent and Progressive**: Logical progression across grade levels
4. **Evidence-Based**: Grounded in research about learning and development
5. **Internationally Benchmarked**: Aligned with high-performing nations

### Standards-Based Education Benefits

**For Students**:
- Clear learning expectations
- Consistent education regardless of location
- Preparation for college and career

**For Teachers**:
- Guidance for curriculum planning
- Framework for assessment design
- Common language for collaboration

**For Systems**:
- Accountability measures
- Quality assurance
- Equity in educational opportunity
