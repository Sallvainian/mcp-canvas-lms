# ADDIE Model - Instructional Design Framework

## Overview

ADDIE is a systematic instructional design framework consisting of five phases: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation. Originally developed for the U.S. military in the 1970s, ADDIE has become the most widely used instructional design model in education and training.

**Purpose**: Provides a structured approach to creating effective, efficient, and engaging learning experiences through systematic planning and iterative improvement.

## Core Principles

1. **Systematic Approach**: Logical, sequential phases ensure thorough planning
2. **Iterative Process**: Evaluation informs continuous improvement across phases
3. **Learner-Centered**: Focus on learner needs, characteristics, and outcomes
4. **Evidence-Based**: Decisions grounded in analysis and assessment data
5. **Flexible Framework**: Adaptable to various contexts while maintaining rigor

## Five Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis

**Purpose**: Identify learning problem and define solution parameters

**Key Questions**:
- What is the performance gap or learning need?
- Who are the learners and what are their characteristics?
- What are the learning goals and objectives?
- What constraints exist (time, resources, technology)?
- What is the learning context and environment?

**Analysis Components**:

**1. Needs Assessment**
- Performance gap analysis
- Root cause identification
- Priority determination
- Solution feasibility

**2. Learner Analysis**
- Prior knowledge and skills
- Learning preferences and styles
- Motivation and attitudes
- Physical/cognitive abilities
- Cultural and linguistic backgrounds
- Technology access and literacy

**3. Task Analysis**
- Break down learning content
- Identify prerequisite skills
- Sequence learning components
- Determine complexity levels

**4. Environmental Analysis**

## Iterative Nature of ADDIE

**Continuous Improvement Cycle**:

```
Analysis ─→ Design ─→ Development ─→ Implementation ─→ Evaluation
    ↑                                                        ↓
    └────────────────── Revision/Refinement ←───────────────┘
```

**Iteration Points**:
- **During Design**: Refine based on analysis insights
- **During Development**: Adjust based on prototype testing
- **During Implementation**: Modify based on learner feedback
- **After Evaluation**: Comprehensive revision for next iteration

**Agile ADDIE**:
Modern adaptations allow for:
- Parallel phase work (overlapping phases)
- Rapid prototyping and testing
- Incremental releases
- Continuous evaluation and adjustment
