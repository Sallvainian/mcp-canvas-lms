edge_case_handling:
  conflicting_standards:

      provides standards interpretation, team consensus required

  infeasible_canvas_implementation:
    process: >
      EdTech Integrator proposes alternatives, Curriculum Architect evaluates
      pedagogical impact, team agrees on acceptable compromise

  assessment_misalignment:
    process: >
      Assessment Specialist documents concerns, Curriculum Architect revises
      objectives or Assessment Specialist redesigns assessments

  scope_creep:
    process: >
      Curriculum Architect enforces boundaries, team votes on essential vs.
      optional additions, pacing guide determines final inclusion

integration_notes:
  - Team operates best with clear standards documents (CCSS, NGSS, state standards)
  - Requires course-level parameters (grade level, duration, student population)
  - Benefits from existing curriculum artifacts when doing redesign work
  - Canvas implementation blueprint should be validated before content creation
  - Assessment framework should be established before detailed lesson planning
  - Consider cognitive load and developmental appropriateness throughout process
