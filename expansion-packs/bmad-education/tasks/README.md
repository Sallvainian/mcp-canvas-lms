# BMAD Education Pack - Task Workflows

Comprehensive step-by-step task workflows for educational design and Canvas course implementation using evidence-based instructional design frameworks.

## Overview

These task workflows guide educators through systematic, theory-grounded course development from initial planning through Canvas implementation and ongoing management. Each workflow integrates multiple educational frameworks (Bloom's Taxonomy, Webb's DOK, UbD, UDL, Gagne's Events) with practical Canvas MCP tool usage.

## Task Dependencies

```
create-learning-objectives.md
    ↓
design-scope-sequence.md
    ↓
create-curriculum-map.md
    ↓
apply-backward-design.md
    ↓
    ├─→ design-lesson-plan.md
    ├─→ create-assessment.md → create-rubric.md
    ├─→ apply-udl.md
    └─→ differentiate-content.md
            ↓
implement-canvas-course.md
```

**Critical Path**:
1. Learning objectives MUST come first (foundation for everything)
2. Backward design should precede detailed lesson planning
3. UDL and differentiation should be applied during design, not retrofitted
4. Canvas implementation is last (after all design complete)
