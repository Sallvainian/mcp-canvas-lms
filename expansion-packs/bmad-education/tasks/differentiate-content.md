# Differentiate Content Task

## Purpose
Design and implement targeted differentiation strategies to address specific learner readiness levels, interests, and learning profiles while maintaining high expectations and rigorous learning objectives for all students.

## Prerequisites
- Learning objectives established (see `create-learning-objectives.md`)
- Lesson plan or unit designed (see `design-lesson-plan.md`)
- Understanding of learner characteristics and needs
- UDL principles familiarity (see `apply-udl.md`)
- Assessment data about learner readiness (see `create-assessment.md`)
- Access to Canvas MCP tools

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Identify Differentiation Focus
**Actions:**
1. Determine what to differentiate:
   - **Content**: WHAT students learn (concepts, skills)
   - **Process**: HOW students learn (activities, strategies)
   - **Product**: HOW students demonstrate learning (assessments)
   - **Environment**: WHERE and with WHOM students learn

2. Identify student differences to address:
   - **Readiness**: Current skill/knowledge level
   - **Interest**: Topics/contexts that motivate
   - **Learning Profile**: Preferred learning approaches

3. Decide differentiation approach:
   - **Responsive**: Adjust based on formative assessment
   - **Proactive**: Plan multiple pathways in advance
   - **Combination**: Planned flexibility with responsive adjustments

**Tools/Resources:**
- `templates/lesson-plan-tmpl.yaml` - Lesson planning with differentiation
- Learner profile data and pre-assessment results
- Formative assessment data

**Canvas Integration:**
- `canvas_get_course` - Review learner data
- `canvas_list_students` - Access learner information
- Canvas Analytics for readiness data

**Expected Outcome:**

### Step 2: Assess Learner Readiness
**Actions:**
1. Use formative assessment to determine readiness:
   - Pre-assessments for prior knowledge
   - Diagnostic assessments for skill levels
   - Exit tickets for ongoing monitoring
   - Observation and anecdotal notes

2. Group learners by readiness (flexible groups):
   - **Below grade level**: Needs foundational support
   - **On grade level**: Ready for grade-level challenges
   - **Above grade level**: Needs extension and complexity

3. Identify specific gaps and strengths

**Readiness Assessment Methods:**
```yaml
Pre-Assessment Options:
  Quick Methods:
    - Entrance ticket with 3-5 questions
    - KWL chart (Know-Want-Learned)
    - Thumbs up/down/sideways check
    - Quick poll or quiz

  In-Depth Methods:
    - Pre-test aligned to objectives
    - Performance task sample
    - Concept mapping
    - Interview or conference

Ongoing Formative Assessment:
  - Exit tickets daily
  - Quick checks during instruction
  - Student self-assessment
  - Peer discussion observations
```

**Canvas Integration:**
- `canvas_create_quiz` - Pre-assessment creation
- `canvas_get_submission` - Review assessment data
- `canvas_list_submissions` - Analyze readiness patterns

**Tools/Resources:**
- Formative assessment templates
- Canvas quiz analytics
- Student performance data

**Expected Outcome:**
Clear understanding of learner readiness levels and grouping strategy

### Step 3: Differentiate Content (WHAT)
**Principle**: All learners work toward same learning objectives but may access content at different levels of complexity, abstraction, or depth.

**Actions:**

**3.1 Complexity Variation**
Adjust complexity while maintaining rigor:

```yaml
Below Readiness:
  Strategy: Foundational Focus
  - Simplified texts (lower lexile levels)
  - Concrete examples before abstractions
  - Fewer variables/steps at once
  - Visual supports and manipulatives
  - Direct instruction with modeling

  Example (Math - Algebra):
    - Practice solving x + 5 = 12
    - Use visual models (balance scales)
    - Step-by-step worked examples
    - Calculator allowed

On Level:
  Strategy: Grade-Level Challenge
  - Standard grade-level texts
  - Balance concrete and abstract
  - Multiple-step problems
  - Some independent problem-solving
  - Mix of guided and independent work

  Example (Math - Algebra):
    - Solve 2x + 7 = 19
    - Explain solution strategy
    - Check answer by substitution
    - Some word problems

Above Readiness:
  Strategy: Extension and Depth
  - Complex texts (higher lexile)
  - Abstract reasoning emphasized
  - Multi-variable problems
  - Independent inquiry
  - Problem-posing opportunities

  Example (Math - Algebra):
    - Solve 3(2x - 4) + 5 = 2x + 9
    - Create own word problem
    - Multiple solution strategies
    - Justify most efficient approach
```

**3.2 Depth and Breadth Variation**
Adjust depth of exploration:

```yaml
Surface Level (Building Foundation):

  - Key examples
  - Fundamental relationships

  Example (History - Civil War):
    - Who fought? When? Where?
    - Main causes (simplified)
    - Key figures (5 people)
    - Basic timeline

Standard Depth (Grade-Level):
  - Core + supporting concepts
  - Extended vocabulary
  - Multiple examples
  - Cause-effect relationships

  Example (History - Civil War):
    - Regional differences
    - Multiple causation factors
    - Key battles and significance
    - Broader context (global)

Deep Exploration (Extension):
  - Core + nuanced concepts
  - Specialized vocabulary
  - Complex examples
  - Systems thinking/interconnections

  Example (History - Civil War):
    - Economic systems analysis
    - Political philosophy examination
    - Social movements context
    - Long-term global impacts
```

**3.3 Resource Variation**

    - Standard length and complexity
    - Some support materials
    - Self-guided resources

  Above Level:
    - Challenging primary sources
    - Longer, complex texts
    - Fewer scaffolds
    - Extension readings

Media Resources:
  Below Level:
    - Short video segments (3-5 min)
    - Clear visuals and demonstrations
    - Repetition and review
    - Closed captions always on

  On Level:
    - Standard-length videos (8-12 min)
    - Balanced explanation
    - Some note-taking required
    - Optional captions

  Above Level:
    - Longer, in-depth content
    - Expert-level explanations
    - Independent analysis
    - Supplementary materials
```

**Canvas Integration:**
- `canvas_create_module` - Organize tiered resources

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Confusing differentiation with individualization**
   - ❌ "Create 30 different lesson plans for 30 students"
   - ✅ "Create 3-4 flexible pathways based on readiness/interest"

2. **Differentiating by quantity instead of quality**
   - ❌ "Advanced students do 20 problems, others do 10"
   - ✅ "All do 10 problems, but complexity varies by readiness"

3. **Creating permanent ability groups**
   - ❌ "The Eagles, The Robins, The Sparrows" (never change)
   - ✅ Flexible grouping that changes weekly based on formative data

4. **Lowering expectations for struggling learners**
   - ❌ "Tier 1 students just need to memorize facts"
   - ✅ "Tier 1 students analyze with more scaffolding"

5. **Making differentiation obvious and stigmatizing**
   - ❌ "The slow group does the baby work"
   - ✅ "Everyone has choices; work on what challenges you appropriately"

6. **Differentiating everything all the time**
   - ❌ Exhausting, unsustainable, often unnecessary
   - ✅ Strategic differentiation where it matters most

7. **Assuming differentiation = more work for teacher**
   - ❌ "I have to create everything from scratch"
   - ✅ Use tiered activities, student choice, flexible grouping

8. **Neglecting formative assessment**
   - ❌ "I'll assume who needs what"
   - ✅ Data-driven differentiation based on evidence

9. **Differentiating without clear objectives**
   - ❌ "Let's offer variety for variety's sake"
   - ✅ All pathways lead to same rigorous objectives

10. **Ignoring student voice and choice**
    - ❌ "I decide everything for students"
    - ✅ Students co-construct learning pathways when appropriate
