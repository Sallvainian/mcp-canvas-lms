# Create Learning Objectives Task

## Purpose
Design measurable, theory-grounded learning objectives using SMART criteria, Bloom's Taxonomy, and Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) framework to ensure clear, assessable learning outcomes.

## Prerequisites
- Course/lesson topic identified
- Target learner audience defined
- Course/module standards or competencies identified
- Access to Canvas MCP tools
- Familiarity with Bloom's Taxonomy and DOK levels

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Identify Learning Context
1. Define the scope (course, module, lesson, or activity)
2. Identify target learner characteristics (grade level, prior knowledge)
3. Review relevant standards (state, national, institutional)
4. Determine time frame for learning
5. **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_get_course` to review course context

### Step 2: Determine Cognitive Level
1. Select appropriate Bloom's level(s) for your objectives:
   - **Remember**: Recall facts, terms, concepts
   - **Understand**: Explain ideas, summarize concepts
   - **Apply**: Use information in new situations
   - **Analyze**: Draw connections, examine relationships
   - **Evaluate**: Justify decisions, critique approaches
   - **Create**: Produce original work, design solutions

2. Align with Webb's DOK level:
   - **DOK 1**: Recall and reproduction
   - **DOK 2**: Skills and concepts
   - **DOK 3**: Strategic thinking
   - **DOK 4**: Extended thinking

3. Match cognitive levels to learner needs and program goals

### Step 3: Draft SMART Objectives
Write objectives that are:
- **Specific**: Clear, precise description of learning
- **Measurable**: Observable, assessable outcomes
- **Achievable**: Realistic given time and resources
- **Relevant**: Aligned to standards and learner needs
- **Time-bound**: Achievable within defined timeframe

**Formula**: [Audience] will [Action Verb] [Content/Concept] [Context/Condition] [Criteria for Success]

### Step 4: Use Action Verbs Appropriately
Select verbs matching cognitive level:

**Bloom's Remember (DOK 1)**
- define, list, identify, recall, recognize, state

**Bloom's Understand (DOK 1-2)**
- describe, explain, summarize, paraphrase, interpret

**Bloom's Apply (DOK 2)**
- demonstrate, solve, use, apply, implement, execute

**Bloom's Analyze (DOK 3)**
- compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, categorize, investigate

**Bloom's Evaluate (DOK 3-4)**
- critique, justify, assess, defend, evaluate, judge

**Bloom's Create (DOK 4)**
- design, construct, develop, formulate, compose, create

### Step 5: Ensure Alignment
1. Verify objectives align with:
   - Course/program standards
   - Assessment methods (see `create-assessment.md`)
   - Instructional activities
   - Prerequisites and subsequent learning

2. Check backward design alignment (see `apply-backward-design.md`)

### Step 6: Write in Student-Friendly Language
1. Translate objectives into "I can" statements for learners
2. Remove jargon and technical language
3. Make objectives accessible and motivating
4. **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_create_page` to publish objectives page

### Step 7: Validate Quality
Run through quality checklist:
- [ ] Observable/measurable action verb used?
- [ ] Appropriate cognitive level for learners?
- [ ] Aligned with standards/competencies?
- [ ] Single learning outcome per objective?
- [ ] Free from vague language ("understand", "know", "learn")?
- [ ] Assessable with available methods?
- [ ] Written from learner perspective?

### Step 8: Document in Canvas
1. **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_create_module` for objectives module
2. **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_create_page` to create objectives page
3. Include:
   - Module/lesson title
   - Learning objectives (bulleted list)
   - "By the end of this [module/lesson], you will be able to..."
   - Student-friendly "I can" statements
   - Connection to assessments

### Step 9: Review and Iterate
1. Peer review with colleagues
2. Pilot test with sample learners
3. Revise based on feedback
4. **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_update_page` to refine objectives

## Tools Needed

### Canvas MCP Tools
- `canvas_get_course` - Review course context
- `canvas_create_module` - Create objectives module
- `canvas_create_page` - Publish objectives page
- `canvas_update_page` - Revise objectives
- `canvas_list_modules` - Review module structure

### Templates
- `templates/learning-objectives-template.md` - Objective writing template
- `templates/blooms-dok-matrix.md` - Taxonomy alignment tool

### Checklists
- `checklists/smart-objectives-checklist.md` - Quality validation
- `checklists/alignment-checklist.md` - Standards alignment

## Quality Checks

### Validation Criteria
1. **Measurability**: Can you observe/assess this outcome?
2. **Clarity**: Would a colleague interpret this the same way?
3. **Alignment**: Does this support course/program goals?
4. **Appropriateness**: Matches learner developmental level?
5. **Completeness**: Covers essential knowledge/skills?

### Assessment Alignment Check
For each objective, identify:
- How will you assess this? (formative/summative)
- What evidence demonstrates achievement?
- What criteria define success?

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Avoid These Mistakes
1. **Vague verbs**: "understand", "know", "learn", "appreciate"
   - ✅ Instead: "explain", "identify", "demonstrate", "evaluate"

2. **Multiple objectives in one statement**
   - ❌ "Students will analyze data and create visualizations"
   - ✅ Split: "Students will analyze data patterns" AND "Students will create data visualizations"

3. **Describing activities instead of outcomes**
   - ❌ "Students will watch a video about photosynthesis"
   - ✅ "Students will explain the process of photosynthesis"

4. **Unrealistic scope for timeframe**
   - ❌ "Students will master advanced calculus" (in one week)
   - ✅ "Students will solve derivative problems using chain rule"

5. **Non-assessable objectives**
   - ❌ "Students will appreciate the importance of history"
   - ✅ "Students will evaluate historical events' impact on modern society"

6. **Mismatched cognitive levels**
   - ❌ DOK 1 objective assessed with DOK 3 task
   - ✅ Align: DOK 2 objective → DOK 2 assessment

## Example Walkthrough

### Context
- **Course**: Introduction to Psychology (undergraduate)
- **Module**: Memory and Cognition
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Standard**: "Analyze theories of memory and apply to real-world scenarios"

### Process

**Step 1: Identify Context**
- Learners: First-year undergraduates, no prior psychology
- Time: 2 weeks (6 contact hours)
- Standards: Introductory psychology competencies

**Step 2: Determine Cognitive Level**
- Bloom's: Understand, Apply, Analyze
- DOK: Level 2 (skills/concepts) and Level 3 (strategic thinking)

**Step 3: Draft SMART Objectives**

**Objective 1** (Understand/DOK 2):
"Students will explain the differences between short-term and long-term memory systems using neurological and behavioral evidence."

**Objective 2** (Apply/DOK 2):
"Students will apply memory encoding strategies (chunking, elaboration, mnemonics) to improve retention of course content."

**Objective 3** (Analyze/DOK 3):
"Students will analyze real-world memory failures (forgetting, false memories) using theories of memory interference and reconstruction."

**Step 4: Action Verbs**
- Objective 1: "explain" (Understand level)
- Objective 2: "apply" (Apply level)
- Objective 3: "analyze" (Analyze level)

**Step 5: Alignment Check**
- ✅ Aligned with course standard
- ✅ Assessable (essay, application task, case analysis)
- ✅ Build on each other (foundational → applied → analytical)

**Step 6: Student-Friendly Version**
```
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- I can explain how short-term and long-term memory work differently
- I can use memory strategies to remember information better
- I can analyze why we forget things or remember them incorrectly
```

**Step 7: Quality Validation**
- [x] Observable verbs? Yes (explain, apply, analyze)
- [x] Measurable? Yes (can assess through assignments)
- [x] Appropriate level? Yes (intro undergrad level)
- [x] Single outcome? Yes (each objective = 1 outcome)
- [x] No vague language? Yes (specific and clear)
- [x] Assessable? Yes (mapped to assessments)

**Step 8: Canvas Documentation**
```bash
# Create module
canvas_create_module(
  course_id=12345,
  name="Module 3: Memory and Cognition",
  position=3
)

# Create objectives page
canvas_create_page(
  course_id=12345,
  title="Module 3 Learning Objectives",
  body="<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
        <p>By the end of this module, you will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explain the differences between short-term and long-term memory...</li>
          <li>Apply memory encoding strategies...</li>
