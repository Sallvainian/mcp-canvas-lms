# Design Scope & Sequence Task

## Purpose
Create a comprehensive scope and sequence plan that maps out learning progression across a course or program, ensuring logical skill development, appropriate pacing, and standards alignment over time.

## Prerequisites
- Course/program goals defined
- Standards or competencies identified
- Target learner characteristics known
- Available instructional time calculated
- Access to Canvas MCP tools
- Familiarity with curriculum design principles

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Define Scope (What to Teach)
1. **Identify Content Domains**
   - List all major topics, concepts, skills, and competencies
   - Organize into logical categories or strands
   - Reference standards documents
   - Consult subject matter experts

2. **Prioritize Content**
   - Mark "essential" vs. "nice to have" content
   - Consider depth vs. breadth trade-offs
   - Align with assessment priorities
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_list_courses` to review program scope

3. **Map to Standards**
   - Link each content area to specific standards
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage
   - Identify gaps or redundancies
   - Document standard codes/identifiers

### Step 2: Determine Sequence (When to Teach)
1. **Identify Prerequisites**
   - Map prerequisite relationships between topics
   - Create dependency chains (Topic A → Topic B → Topic C)
   - Identify foundational vs. advanced content

2. **Apply Sequencing Principles**
   - **Simple to Complex**: Build from basic to sophisticated
   - **Concrete to Abstract**: Start with tangible examples
   - **Chronological**: Use time-based order when appropriate
   - **Part to Whole**: Build components before systems
   - **Spiral**: Revisit concepts with increasing depth

3. **Consider Learning Science**
   - Spaced repetition for retention
   - Interleaving for transfer
   - Retrieval practice opportunities
   - Cognitive load management

### Step 3: Allocate Time
1. **Calculate Available Time**
   - Total course/program hours
   - Number of sessions/meetings

## Tools Needed

### Canvas MCP Tools
- `canvas_list_courses` - Review program scope
- `canvas_create_module` - Build module structure
- `canvas_create_page` - Document scope & sequence
- `canvas_update_course` - Configure pacing settings
- `canvas_list_calendar_events` - Map timeline

- `checklists/standards-coverage.md` - Completeness check

## Quality Checks

### Validation Criteria
1. **Completeness**: All required standards/competencies addressed?
2. **Logical Flow**: Prerequisites taught before dependent content?
3. **Balanced Pacing**: Realistic time allocations?
4. **Coherent Units**: Modules have clear themes and boundaries?
5. **Assessment Alignment**: Assessments strategically placed?
6. **Flexibility**: Buffer time for adaptation built in?
7. **Integration**: Connections within/across content areas?
8. **Accessibility**: Multiple entry points and pathways?

### Prerequisite Logic Check
For each topic/skill:
- What must students know/do before this?
- Is that prerequisite taught earlier in the sequence?
- What will students be able to do after this?
- Does subsequent content build on this foundation?

### Pacing Reality Check
- Total content time ≤ 85% of available time (15% buffer)
- Time estimates validated by pilot or prior experience
- Learner variability accommodated
- Review/remediation time included

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Coverage Over Mastery**
   - ❌ Trying to "cover" everything superficially
   - ✅ Prioritize depth on essential concepts; eliminate non-essentials

2. **Ignoring Prerequisites**
   - ❌ Teaching advanced concepts before foundations
   - ✅ Map prerequisite chains; sequence logically

3. **Unrealistic Pacing**
   - ❌ Cramming too much in too little time
   - ✅ Estimate generously; pilot test; build buffers

4. **Isolated Content**
   - ❌ Teaching topics in silos without connections
   - ✅ Integrate concepts; make explicit connections; spiral curriculum

5. **Front-Loading Difficulty**
   - ❌ Hardest content at beginning of course
   - ✅ Build complexity gradually; scaffold appropriately

6. **Assessment Deserts**
   - ❌ Long periods without formative feedback
   - ✅ Distribute assessments throughout; frequent low-stakes checks

7. **Rigid Sequencing**
   - ❌ No flexibility for learner needs or emerging topics
   - ✅ Build adaptability; allow alternative pathways

## Example Walkthrough

### Context
- **Course**: Introduction to Data Science (undergraduate)
- **Duration**: 15 weeks (3 hours/week = 45 total hours)
- **Level**: Sophomore/junior, math prerequisites met
- **Standards**: University data literacy competencies

### Step 1: Define Scope
**Content Domains Identified:**
1. Data fundamentals (types, collection, ethics)
2. Descriptive statistics & visualization
3. Probability & distributions
4. Inferential statistics
5. Regression & prediction
6. Machine learning basics
7. Data communication

**Prioritization:**
- **Essential**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 (must master)
- **Important**: 5, 6 (exposure level)
- **Optional**: Advanced ML (if time permits)

### Step 2: Determine Sequence
**Prerequisite Mapping:**
```
Data Fundamentals (Week 1-2)
    ↓
Descriptive Statistics (Week 3-4)
    ↓
Probability Basics (Week 5-6)
    ↓
Inferential Statistics (Week 7-9)
    ↓
Regression (Week 10-12)
    ↓
ML Introduction (Week 13-14)
    ↓
Capstone Project (Week 15)
```

**Sequencing Principle Applied**: Simple to complex, part to whole

### Step 3: Allocate Time
**Available Time:** 45 hours
- Instruction: 30 hours (67%)
