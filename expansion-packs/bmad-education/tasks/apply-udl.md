## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Retrofitting instead of designing proactively**
   - ❌ "I'll add accommodations if someone requests them"
   - ✅ "I'll design flexibly from the start for all learners"

2. **Adding features without reducing barriers**
   - ❌ Adding video without captions
   - ✅ Adding captioned video AND transcript AND visual summary

3. **Confusing UDL with differentiation**
   - ❌ "UDL means I create different versions for different groups"
   - ✅ "UDL means I provide flexible options everyone can access"

4. **Overwhelming learners with too many choices**
   - ❌ "Here are 15 ways to do this assignment"
   - ✅ "Choose one of these 3 pathways to demonstrate learning"

5. **Focusing only on technology**
   - ❌ "UDL = using lots of educational technology"
   - ✅ "UDL = removing barriers through thoughtful design (tech is one tool)"

6. **Ignoring one or two UDL principles**
   - ❌ Focusing only on representation (WHAT)
   - ✅ Balancing engagement (WHY), representation (WHAT), expression (HOW)

7. **Not validating accessibility**
   - ❌ "It looks accessible to me"
   - ✅ Test with screen readers, keyboard navigation, assistive tech

8. **Providing options without clear goals**
   - ❌ "Do whatever you want to show learning"
   - ✅ "Choose how to demonstrate [specific learning objective]"
