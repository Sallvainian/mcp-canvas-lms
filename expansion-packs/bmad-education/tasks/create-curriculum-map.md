# Create Curriculum Map Task

## Purpose
Develop a comprehensive curriculum map that documents where and how standards, skills, and assessments are addressed throughout a course or program, ensuring complete coverage and alignment while identifying gaps and redundancies.

## Prerequisites
- Course/program scope defined
- Learning objectives identified
- Standards or competencies document available
- Assessment strategy outlined
- Access to Canvas MCP tools
- Familiarity with curriculum mapping methodology

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Gather Mapping Components
1. **Compile Standards/Competencies**
   - List all required standards (state, national, institutional)
   - Organize by category or domain
   - Include standard codes and full descriptors
   - Note priority/weight of each standard

2. **List Learning Objectives**
   - All course/module objectives (see `create-learning-objectives.md`)
   - Categorized by cognitive level (Bloom's)
   - Organized by unit/module
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_list_modules` to review objectives

3. **Identify Assessments**
   - All formative and summative assessments
   - Major projects, quizzes, exams, performances
   - Assessment types and formats
   - Scoring criteria/rubrics
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_list_assignments` to inventory assessments

4. **Catalog Resources**
   - Textbooks, articles, videos, simulations
   - Learning activities and experiences
   - Technology tools and platforms

### Step 2: Create Mapping Framework
1. **Select Mapping Type**
   - **Consensus Map**: What should be taught (intended curriculum)
   - **Diary Map**: What is actually taught (implemented curriculum)
   - **Projected Map**: What students learn (attained curriculum)
   - **Essential Map**: Minimum common curriculum

2. **Choose Mapping Format**
   - **Matrix/Grid**: Standards × Units/Modules
   - **Timeline**: Chronological sequence
   - **Concept Map**: Visual relationships
   - **Hybrid**: Combination approach

3. **Define Coding System**
   - **I** = Introduced (first exposure)
   - **D** = Developed (practice and deepening)
   - **M** = Mastered (assessment and demonstration)
   - **R** = Reviewed/Reinforced (spiral revisit)
   - Alternative: Use Bloom's taxonomy codes (K, U, Ap, An, E, C)

### Step 3: Map Standards to Content
1. **Horizontal Mapping** (within course)
   - For each unit/module, identify which standards addressed
   - Code exposure level (I, D, M, R)
   - Document specific lessons/activities
   - Note depth of coverage

2. **Create Standards Coverage Matrix**
   ```
   Standard | Unit 1 | Unit 2 | Unit 3 | Unit 4 | Coverage Level
   ---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------------
   STD.1    |   I    |   D    |   M    |   R    | Complete
   STD.2    |        |   I    |   D    |   M    | Complete
   STD.3    |   I    |   D    |        |        | Partial
   ```

3. **Verify Complete Coverage**
   - Every standard appears at least once?
   - Every standard reaches "Mastery" level?
   - Appropriate depth for standard priority?
   - **Template**: `templates/standards-coverage-matrix.xlsx`

### Step 4: Map Assessments to Standards
1. **Assessment Alignment Grid**
   - List all assessments (rows)
   - List all standards (columns)
   - Mark which standards each assessment measures
   - Indicate assessment weight/importance

2. **Verify Assessment Coverage**
   - Each standard assessed at least once?
   - Multiple assessment opportunities for critical standards?
   - Balance of formative and summative?
   - Appropriate rigor level for standard?

3. **Document Assessment Methods**
   - How each standard is assessed
   - Type of evidence required
   - Scoring criteria
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_get_assignment` for assessment details

### Step 5: Map Skills and Competencies
1. **Identify Transferable Skills**
   - Critical thinking
   - Communication (written, oral, visual)
   - Collaboration and teamwork
   - Digital literacy
   - Self-directed learning
   - Creativity and innovation

2. **Map Skills Across Units**
   - Where are skills explicitly taught?
   - Where are skills practiced?
   - Where are skills assessed?
   - Progression of skill development

3. **Create Skills Matrix**
   ```
   Skill            | Unit 1 | Unit 2 | Unit 3 | Development Arc
   -----------------|--------|--------|--------|------------------
   Critical Think   |   I    |   D    |   M    | Scaffolded
   Communication    |   I    |   D,M  |   D,M  | Ongoing
   Collaboration    |        |   I,D  |   M    | Concentrated
   ```

### Step 6: Analyze for Gaps and Redundancies
1. **Gap Analysis**
   - Standards not addressed? (add to curriculum)
   - Standards introduced but never mastered? (adjust depth)
   - Skills mentioned but not practiced? (create activities)
   - Assessments without clear standards? (realign or remove)

2. **Redundancy Analysis**
   - Same content repeated unnecessarily?
   - Overlapping objectives without progression?
   - Multiple assessments of same thing?
   - Opportunities for consolidation or elimination?

3. **Balance Analysis**
   - Equitable distribution of content across units?
   - Appropriate pacing and cognitive load?
   - Varied assessment types and formats?
   - Adequate time for deep learning?

### Step 7: Map Vertical Alignment
1. **Prerequisites** (What comes before)
   - Map to prior course standards
   - Identify assumed knowledge/skills
   - Note prerequisite gaps to address
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_list_courses` to review program

2. **Subsequent Learning** (What comes after)
   - Map to next course standards
   - Ensure essential foundations covered
   - Note connections to advanced content

3. **Create Vertical Alignment Chart**
   - Prior course standards (column 1)
   - Current course standards (column 2)
   - Next course standards (column 3)
   - Draw connection arrows

### Step 8: Add Contextual Details
1. **Resources and Materials**
   - Map resources to specific standards/units
   - Note required vs. supplemental materials
   - Include links to digital resources
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_list_files` to document resources

2. **Instructional Strategies**

3. **Time Allocations**
   - Hours/days per standard
   - Pacing recommendations
   - Flexibility indicators
   - Reference to scope & sequence (see `design-scope-sequence.md`)

### Step 9: Visualize and Document
1. **Create Visual Curriculum Map**
   - Use color coding for clarity
   - Include legends and keys
   - Make it scannable and user-friendly
   - Export in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, web)

2. **Build Digital Map in Canvas**
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_create_page` for interactive map

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Mapping Without Purpose**
   - ❌ Creating map as compliance exercise only
   - ✅ Use map as living document for improvement

2. **Over-Complication**
   - ❌ Including every minutiae; 50+ page maps
   - ✅ Focus on essential components; keep it usable

3. **Static Document**
   - ❌ Map created once and never updated
   - ✅ Regular reviews; responsive to changes

4. **Misaligned Assessments**
   - ❌ Assessments don't match stated standards
   - ✅ Verify every assessment-standard link

5. **Ignoring Vertical Alignment**
   - ❌ Mapping only within single course
   - ✅ Show connections to prior/subsequent learning

6. **Vague Coding**
   - ❌ Unclear what "covered" means
   - ✅ Use specific codes (I, D, M, R) consistently

7. **Neglecting Skills**
   - ❌ Mapping only content standards
   - ✅ Include transferable skills and competencies

## Example Walkthrough

### Context

Politics & Power               |   I    |   D    |   D    | ... |   M    | Complete
...
```

**Skills Coverage Matrix (excerpt):**
```
Historical Thinking Skill | Unit 1 | Unit 2 | Unit 3 | Development
--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------
Causation                 |   I    |   D    |   D,M  | Progressive

Comparison                |        |   I    |   D,M  | Concentrated
...
```

### Step 4: Map Assessments to Standards

**Assessment Alignment Grid (excerpt):**
```
Assessment    | Type | Themes Assessed              | Skills Assessed | Weight
--------------|------|------------------------------|-----------------|-------
Unit 1 Exam   | Sum  | Identity, Migration, Geo     | Causation, CCOT | 8%
DBQ #1        | Form | Identity, Politics           | Argumentation   | 3%
DBQ #2        | Sum  | Work/Tech, Migration         | Evidence use    | 5%
Long Essay #1 | Sum  | All Unit 1-3 themes          | Argumentation   | 10%
Mock AP       | Sum  | All 9 themes                 | All 8 skills    | 15%
...
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ All 9 themes assessed multiple times
- ✅ All 8 skills practiced and assessed
- ✅ Balance: 60% summative, 40% formative
- ✅ Cognitive levels match (DBQ = Analyze/Evaluate)

### Step 5: Map Skills and Competencies

**Transferable Skills Map:**
```
Skill               | Units 1-3 | Units 4-6 | Units 7-9 | Assessment
--------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------------
Historical Thinking |    I,D    |    D,M    |    M,R    | All DBQs, essays
Reading Comp        |    I,D    |    D,M    |    M      | Reading quizzes
Argumentative Write |    I      |    D      |    M      | Essays, DBQs
Source Analysis     |    I,D    |    D,M    |    M,R    | DBQs, exams
Research Skills     |           |    I,D    |    M      | Research project
```

### Step 6: Analyze for Gaps and Redundancies

**Gap Analysis:**
- ❌ Theme "American in the World" only Introduced, never Mastered
  - **Fix**: Add mastery assessment in Unit 8
- ❌ "Contextualization" skill practiced but not explicitly assessed
  - **Fix**: Add contextualization to DBQ rubric
- ✅ All other standards reach mastery

**Redundancy Analysis:**
- ❌ Units 2 and 3 both have identical "Colonial Economy" content
  - **Fix**: Consolidate in Unit 2; Unit 3 focuses on consequences
- ✅ Spiral review is intentional, not redundant

### Step 7: Map Vertical Alignment

**Vertical Alignment Chart:**
```
Prior Course (8th Grade)  →  AP U.S. History (11th)  →  Next Course (AP Gov)
------------------------     -------------------------     --------------------
Basic US History timeline → Thematic analysis         → Political systems
Colonial period overview  → Deep dive into causes     → Constitutional framework
Memorization of facts     → Historical thinking skills → Policy analysis
                          → Argumentation & evidence  → Applied to current events
```

**Connections:**
- Prior: Assumes chronological knowledge of major events (will review as needed)
- Next: Provides foundation in constitutional interpretation and civic engagement

### Step 8: Add Contextual Details

**Resources Mapped:**
- Unit 1: Textbook Ch. 1-3, *The Columbian Exchange* (Crosby), primary sources packet
- Unit 2: Textbook Ch. 4-6, digital archive at Library of Congress
- DBQ practice: College Board released questions 2015-2024

**Instructional Strategies:**
- Socratic seminars (Units 2, 5, 8)
- Document analysis protocol (all units)
- Jigsaw for textbook readings (Units 3-9)
- Differentiation: Tiered primary sources, graphic organizers, extended time

**Time Allocations:**
- Unit 1: 4 weeks (historical thinking foundations + content)
- Units 2-8: 3.5 weeks each
- Unit 9: 3 weeks + 1 week review
- Total: 32 weeks instruction + 2 weeks AP review + 2 weeks flex

### Step 9: Visualize and Document

**Visual Map Created:**
- Color-coded by theme (9 colors)
- Timeline format showing unit progression
- Icons for assessment types
- Hyperlinked to Canvas modules

**Canvas Documentation:**
```python
canvas_create_page(
    course_id=12345,
    title="AP U.S. History Curriculum Map",
    body="""
    <h2>Course Overview & Standards Alignment</h2>
    <p>This map shows where each AP theme and skill is addressed throughout the year.</p>

    <h3>Themes Coverage</h3>
    [Insert interactive matrix/chart]

    <h3>Skills Development</h3>
