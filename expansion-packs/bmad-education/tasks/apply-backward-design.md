# Apply Backward Design Task

## Purpose
Implement Understanding by Design (UbD) framework using the 3-stage backward design process to create curriculum focused on meaningful learning, authentic performance, and enduring understanding rather than activity-based coverage.

## Prerequisites
- Course/unit topic identified
- Standards or learning goals defined
- Familiarity with Understanding by Design (UbD) framework
- Access to Canvas MCP tools
- Willingness to plan "backwards" from desired results

## Step-by-Step Process

### Stage 1: Identify Desired Results

#### Step 1.1: Establish Goals
1. **Review Standards and Expectations**
   - List relevant content standards
   - Identify program/institutional goals
   - Note student performance expectations
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_get_course` to review course description

2. **Prioritize by Type**
   - **Worth being familiar with**: Exposure-level content, vocabulary, basic facts
   - **Important to know and do**: Core concepts, key skills, essential processes
   - **Enduring understandings**: Big ideas that transfer beyond the course

3. **Apply Filtering Questions**
   - To what extent does this idea/topic/process represent a "big idea"?
   - To what extent does it reside at the heart of the discipline?
   - To what extent does it require uncoverage (counterintuitive, prone to misunderstanding)?
   - To what extent does it engage students?

#### Step 1.2: Define Enduring Understandings
1. **Craft Understanding Statements**
   - Written as full-sentence generalizations
   - Transferable beyond specific examples
   - Abstract enough to apply broadly
   - Specific enough to guide instruction

   **Formula**: Students will understand that [generalization about how the world works]

   **Examples**:
   - "Effective writers adapt their style and structure based on audience and purpose" (not just "know parts of speech")
   - "Historical events have multiple causes and perspectives" (not just "know dates")
   - "Mathematical models simplify reality to reveal patterns" (not just "solve equations")

2. **Avoid These Pitfalls**
   - ❌ "Students will understand photosynthesis" (topic, not understanding)
   - ❌ "Students will understand that plants need light" (simple fact)
   - ✅ "Students will understand that organisms have evolved interdependent relationships in ecosystems"

#### Step 1.3: Articulate Essential Questions
1. **Generate Questions That**
   - Are provocative and intellectually engaging
   - Lead to enduring understandings
   - Recur naturally throughout learning
   - Have no single, final answer
   - Raise further questions

2. **Types of Essential Questions**
   - **Overarching** (across units): "What makes a great story?"
   - **Topical** (within unit): "How did geography shape ancient civilizations?"

3. **Quality Check**
   - Is it arguable? (Multiple valid perspectives?)
   - Is it recurring? (Comes up naturally in learning?)
   - Is it thought-provoking? (Stimulates inquiry?)

   **Examples**:
   - "To what extent should we sacrifice freedom for security?"
   - "How do artists use constraints to fuel creativity?"
   - "When is a mathematical answer 'good enough'?"

#### Step 1.4: Specify Knowledge and Skills
1. **List Key Knowledge** (Students will know...)
   - Essential facts, vocabulary, principles
   - Content required for understanding
   - Prerequisite information

2. **List Key Skills** (Students will be able to...)
   - Discrete skills to be performed
   - Processes to be followed
   - Techniques to be mastered

3. **Align to Standards**
   - Connect each item to specific standards
   - Ensure coverage of required content
   - **Template**: `templates/stage1-desired-results.md`

### Stage 2: Determine Acceptable Evidence

#### Step 2.1: Identify Assessment Types
1. **Performance Tasks** (Authentic assessment)
   - Complex, multi-step challenges
   - Real-world application
   - Transfer required
   - Examples: Design challenge, research project, case study analysis

2. **Other Evidence** (Traditional assessment)
   - Quizzes, tests, prompts
   - Observations, dialogues
   - Self-assessments, reflections
   - Checks for understanding

#### Step 2.2: Design Performance Task (Transfer Task)
1. **Use GRASPS Framework**
   - **G**oal: What should students accomplish?
   - **R**ole: What role/perspective will students take?
   - **A**udience: Who is the authentic audience?
   - **S**ituation: What is the context/challenge?
   - **P**roduct/Performance: What will students create/do?
   - **S**tandards: What are the criteria for success?

2. **Example GRASPS Task**
   ```
   Goal: Design a sustainable community garden
   Role: Urban planning consultant
   Audience: City council and community members
   Situation: City wants to convert vacant lot into community asset
   Product: Design proposal with budget, layout, sustainability plan
   Standards: Addresses environmental, social, economic sustainability
   ```

3. **Ensure Authentic Transfer**
   - Requires application in new context
   - No "cookbook" procedure to follow
   - Judgment and innovation required
   - Mirrors real-world performance

#### Step 2.3: Create Rubric or Scoring Guide
1. **Identify Criteria**
   - What specific qualities define excellent work?
   - What are the dimensions of performance?
   - Align directly to enduring understandings

2. **Define Performance Levels**
   - Typically 3-5 levels (e.g., Exemplary, Proficient, Developing, Beginning)
   - Clear descriptors for each level
   - Observable, measurable indicators
   - (See `create-rubric.md` for detailed process)

3. **Validate Rubric**
   - Does it assess enduring understandings?
   - Does it distinguish quality performance?
   - Can students use it for self-assessment?
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_create_rubric` to build scoring tool

#### Step 2.4: Plan Other Evidence
1. **Formative Assessments**
   - Pre-assessments (prior knowledge, misconceptions)
   - Progress checks (exit tickets, quick writes)
   - Practice performances (low-stakes versions)

2. **Student Self-Assessment**
   - Reflection prompts
   - Self-evaluation against criteria
   - Goal-setting and tracking

3. **Create Assessment Blueprint**
   - Map evidence to enduring understandings
   - Ensure multiple measures
   - Balance formative and summative
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_list_assignments` to organize assessments

### Stage 3: Plan Learning Experiences

#### Step 3.1: Apply WHERETO Elements
Design learning experiences using WHERETO acronym:

1. **W - Where and Why**
   - Help students understand WHERE learning is going
   - Explain WHY it matters (hook, essential questions)
   - Share enduring understandings and goals upfront

2. **H - Hook and Hold**
   - Engage students' interest from start
   - Maintain engagement throughout
   - Use essential questions, provocative scenarios

3. **E - Equip and Experience**
   - EQUIP students with necessary knowledge/skills
   - Provide guided EXPERIENCES and instruction
   - Scaffold from simple to complex

4. **R - Rethink and Revise**
   - Opportunities to RETHINK big ideas
   - REVISE work based on feedback
   - Reflect on learning and performance

5. **E - Evaluate**
   - Students EVALUATE their work and learning
   - Self-assessment against criteria
   - Peer feedback and reflection

6. **T - Tailored**
   - Learning is TAILORED to student needs
   - Differentiation by readiness, interest, learning profile
   - (See `apply-udl.md` for Universal Design)

7. **O - Organized**
   - Learning is ORGANIZED for maximum engagement and effectiveness
   - Logical sequence and coherent flow
   - Appropriate pacing and chunking

#### Step 3.2: Design Learning Activities
1. **Start with the End in Mind**
   - What must students do to succeed on performance task?
   - What knowledge/skills are required?
   - What common misconceptions must be addressed?

2. **Sequence for Understanding**
   - Pre-assessment (uncover prior knowledge and misconceptions)
   - Direct instruction (introduce core concepts)
   - Guided practice (structured application)
   - Independent application (transfer tasks)
   - Reflection and revision (metacognition)

3. **Ensure Alignment**
   - Every activity serves the enduring understandings
   - Activities build toward performance task
   - No "fun but random" activities

4. **Incorporate UDL Principles**
   - Multiple means of representation
   - Multiple means of engagement
   - Multiple means of action/expression
   - (See `apply-udl.md` for implementation)

#### Step 3.3: Plan Differentiation
1. **Anticipate Student Needs**
   - Readiness levels (prerequisite skills)
   - Interests (hooks and entry points)
   - Learning profiles (preferences, strengths)

2. **Differentiation Strategies**
   - Tiered assignments (varying complexity)
   - Flexible grouping (by need or interest)
   - Choice boards or menus
   - Varied scaffolding and support

3. **Document in Planning**
   - Note differentiation points in lesson plans
   - Prepare varied materials in advance
   - Build choice into assessments where appropriate

#### Step 3.4: Map to Canvas Course Structure
1. **Create Module Structure**
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_create_module` for each unit
   - Organize by enduring understanding or essential question
   - Logical progression through WHERETO

2. **Populate Module Content**
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_create_page` for content pages
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_create_assignment` for tasks
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_create_discussion_topic` for discourse
   - Include formative and summative assessments

3. **Publish Learning Pathway**
   - Make essential questions and understandings visible
   - Provide roadmap for students
   - Link assessments to learning goals explicitly

### Integration and Iteration

#### Step 4: Review for Alignment
1. **Use UbD Design Standards**
   - Stage 1: Are understandings enduring and transferable?
   - Stage 2: Do assessments require transfer and reveal understanding?
   - Stage 3: Do activities build toward desired results?

2. **Check Alignment Across Stages**
   - Do assessments (Stage 2) measure understandings (Stage 1)?
   - Do activities (Stage 3) prepare for assessments (Stage 2)?
   - Is everything aligned to standards and goals?

3. **Self-Assessment Checklist**
   - [ ] Enduring understandings are big ideas, not topics
   - [ ] Essential questions are provocative and recurring
   - [ ] Performance task requires authentic transfer
   - [ ] Rubric assesses understanding, not just compliance
   - [ ] Learning plan uses WHERETO elements
   - [ ] All components align (Stage 1 → 2 → 3)
   - **Checklist**: `checklists/ubd-alignment-check.md`

#### Step 5: Pilot and Refine
1. **Test with Students**
   - Observe where understanding emerges or falters
   - Note which activities effectively promote understanding
   - Gather evidence of transfer

2. **Collect Feedback**
   - Student reflections on essential questions
   - Performance task results and patterns
   - Formative assessment data

3. **Iterate Design**
   - Refine enduring understandings for clarity
   - Adjust essential questions for engagement
   - Revise activities to better support understanding
   - **Canvas Tool**: `canvas_update_module` to improve course

- **Evidence**: Multiple measures, formative and summative, reveals understanding

### Stage 3 Quality Indicators
- **WHERETO**: All 7 elements present and integrated
- **Alignment**: Activities build toward assessment and understanding
- **Differentiation**: Tailored to student needs, multiple pathways

### Overall UbD Design Quality
- Backward flow: Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 (not forward)
- Focus on understanding, not just coverage
- Assessment-driven (evidence shapes instruction)
- Transfer-oriented (application in new contexts)

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Planning Forward Instead of Backward**
   - ❌ "I'll teach Chapter 1, then Chapter 2, then test"
   - ✅ "What must students understand? How will I know? Then, what experiences?"

2. **Topics Masquerading as Understandings**
   - ❌ "Students will understand the Civil War"
   - ✅ "Students will understand that conflicts often stem from competing values and interests"

3. **Questions That Aren't Essential**
   - ❌ "What year did the Civil War start?" (factual, one answer)
   - ✅ "To what extent was the Civil War inevitable?" (essential, arguable)

4. **Inauthentic Performance Tasks**
   - ❌ "Write an essay about sustainability" (school-only task)
   - ✅ "Design a sustainability plan for your school and present to administrators" (authentic)

5. **Activity-Driven Planning**
   - ❌ "This is a cool lab, let's do it!"
   - ✅ "Does this lab build understanding of the big idea? If so, include; if not, skip."

6. **Coverage Over Understanding**
   - ❌ Teaching everything superficially
   - ✅ Uncovering big ideas deeply, even if some content is eliminated

7. **Skipping Stage 2**
   - ❌ Going straight from goals (Stage 1) to activities (Stage 3)
   - ✅ Design assessments (Stage 2) before planning instruction

## Example Walkthrough

### Context
- **Course**: High School English 10
- **Unit**: Argument and Persuasion
- **Duration**: 4 weeks
- **Standards**: Write arguments, analyze rhetoric, evaluate claims

### Stage 1: Desired Results

**Established Goals** (from standards):
- Write arguments to support claims using valid reasoning and evidence
- Analyze how authors use rhetoric to advance their point of view
- Evaluate the soundness of reasoning and sufficiency of evidence

**Enduring Understandings** (Students will understand that...):
1. "Effective arguments balance logic, credibility, and emotion to persuade specific audiences"
2. "Claims must be supported by relevant, credible evidence to be convincing"
3. "Recognizing rhetorical strategies helps us evaluate arguments critically"

**Essential Questions**:
1. "What makes an argument convincing?"
2. "How do we know when to trust a claim?"
3. "To what extent should we be persuaded by emotion versus logic?"

**Students will know...**
- Elements of argument (claim, evidence, reasoning, counterargument)
- Rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, logos)
- Types of evidence (data, expert testimony, examples, anecdotes)
- Logical fallacies

**Students will be able to...**
- Construct arguments with clear claims and supporting evidence
- Analyze rhetorical strategies in texts
- Evaluate the credibility of sources and evidence
- Anticipate and address counterarguments

### Stage 2: Acceptable Evidence

**Performance Task** (GRASPS):
```
Goal: Persuade your community to take action on a local issue
Role: Community advocate and policy analyst
Audience: City council and community members
Situation: A local issue requires community attention and action
Product:
  1. Written policy proposal (argumentative essay, 5-7 pages)
  2. Oral presentation to "city council" (class + invited guests)
Performance: Must analyze the issue from multiple perspectives,
  make a compelling claim, support with credible evidence,
  address counterarguments, and adapt argument for oral delivery
Standards/Criteria:
  - Clear, defensible claim
  - Relevant, credible evidence from multiple sources
  - Logical reasoning connecting evidence to claim
  - Acknowledgment and refutation of counterarguments
  - Effective use of rhetorical appeals for audience
  - Professional presentation and delivery
```

**Rubric** (excerpt):
```
Criteria          | Exemplary (4)                  | Proficient (3)
------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------
Claim & Reasoning | Nuanced claim with sophisticated| Clear claim with logical
                  | reasoning that acknowledges    | reasoning connecting
                  | complexity                     | evidence to conclusion

Evidence          | Integrates diverse, highly     | Uses relevant, credible
                  | credible sources; evaluates    | sources with appropriate
                  | quality and relevance          | integration
```

**Other Evidence**:
- Pre-assessment: Analyze sample arguments for strengths/weaknesses
- Formative quizzes: Identify rhetorical appeals, spot fallacies
- Peer review: Evaluate peer drafts using rubric
- Self-reflection: How has your thinking about persuasion evolved?

    name="Pre-Assessment: Analyze MLK Speech",
    description="[Identify argument elements in 'I Have a Dream']",
    points_possible=20
)

# Continue for Weeks 2-4...
```

### Stage 1-2-3 Alignment Check

**Verification**:
- [x] Performance task requires demonstrating all 3 enduring understandings
- [x] Essential questions guide inquiry throughout 4 weeks
- [x] Rubric assesses understanding of effective argumentation (not just format compliance)
- [x] Learning activities build knowledge/skills needed for performance task
- [x] WHERETO elements integrated throughout
- [x] Differentiation addresses student variability
- [x] All standards covered through authentic application

**Evidence of Alignment**:
- EU #1 ("balance logic, credibility, emotion") → Rubric assesses use of appeals → Week 2 teaches rhetorical appeals
- EQ #2 ("when to trust a claim") → Performance task requires evaluating sources → Week 3 teaches evidence evaluation
- Stage 1 skills → Stage 2 assessment → Stage 3 instruction (backward flow maintained)
