### Canvas Implementation Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Course Structure Creation
```javascript
// Curriculum Architect workflow
// 1. Create course
const course = await canvas_create_course({
  account_id: 12345,
  name: "AP Biology",
  course_code: "BIO-101",
  start_at: "2024-08-20",
  end_at: "2025-06-15"
});

// 2. Create modules (units)
const modules = [
  { name: "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life", position: 1 },
  { name: "Unit 2: Cell Structure", position: 2 },
  { name: "Unit 3: Cellular Energetics", position: 3 }
];

for (const mod of modules) {
  await canvas_create_module({
    course_id: course.id,
    name: mod.name,
    position: mod.position,
    require_sequential_progress: true
  });
}

// 3. Set up conditional release (mastery-based)
await canvas_update_module({
  course_id: course.id,
  module_id: 2,
  prerequisite_module_ids: [1],  // Must complete Unit 1 first
  completion_requirement: {
    type: "min_score",
    min_score: 80  // 80% mastery required
  }
});
```

### Best Practices for Canvas Integration

#### 1. Module Organization
- Use modules to represent units/weeks
- Set `require_sequential_progress: true` for scaffolded learning
- Use `prerequisite_module_ids` for mastery-based progression
- Publish modules strategically (not all at once)

#### 2. Assignment Design
- Always include clear description with objectives
- Use rubrics for performance tasks (grading consistency)
- Enable multiple submission types for UDL
- Set realistic due dates with timezone consideration
- Use assignment groups for gradebook organization

#### 3. Differentiation Implementation
- Use assignment overrides for accommodations (not separate assignments)
- Create section-based overrides for tiered tasks
- Leverage conditional release for personalized pathways
- Use groups for collaborative differentiation

#### 4. Accessibility
- Add alt text to ALL images (`alt` attribute)
- Caption all videos (use Canvas Studio)
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3)
- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Check color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Enable Immersive Reader for text-heavy content

#### 5. Assessment & Grading
- Create rubrics BEFORE assignment creation
- Use Canvas rubric builder for criterion-based feedback
- Set posting policies (manual vs automatic grade release)
- Use SpeedGrader for efficient grading workflow
- Provide timely, specific feedback with rubrics

- Group A: Economic causes (tariffs, cotton economy)
- Group B: Political causes (states' rights, federal power)
- Group C: Social causes (abolitionism, culture clash)
- Group D: Precipitating events (Kansas-Nebraska, Dred Scott)

Each group:
- Receives text excerpt + infographic + 3-min video clip (CHOICE of formats)
- Completes graphic organizer
- Prepares to teach their cause to others

[5] PROVIDE GUIDANCE (15 min)
Teacher circulates, provides scaffolds:
- Procedural: Graphic organizer template
- Conceptual: Guiding questions
- Social: Group roles (facilitator, recorder, presenter)

FORMATIVE CHECK: Exit slip after expert groups
"List 2 key points from your cause. What's still unclear?"

[6] ELICIT PERFORMANCE (8 min)
Jigsaw reform: Mix groups so each has A, B, C, D expert
Each expert teaches their cause (2 min each)
Groups complete Venn diagram: How do causes overlap/interact?

[7] PROVIDE FEEDBACK (2 min)
Teacher reviews 2-3 Venn diagrams via document camera
Highlights good examples of causal connections

[8] ASSESS PERFORMANCE (Homework)
**CHOICE BOARD** (UDL Expression):
Choose ONE:
A) Written argument: Which cause was most important? (essay)
B) Cause-effect diagram: Visual representation of interconnections (infographic)
C) Historical speech: Write from perspective of 1860 politician (creative writing)
D) Podcast script: Interview with historical figures about causes (multimedia)

[9] ENHANCE RETENTION (in next lesson)
Begin with: "Yesterday we identified causes. Today: How did they lead to specific battles?"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Agent not activating
**Symptoms**: Agent doesn't respond to activation request

**Solutions**:
1. Verify agent file location: `expansion-packs/bmad-education/agents/`
2. Check agent YAML syntax (use YAML validator)
3. Ensure agent name matches file name
4. Try explicit activation: "Load instructional-designer.md persona"

#### Issue: Canvas MCP tools not working
**Symptoms**: Canvas commands fail or return errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Canvas API key is configured
2. Check Canvas base URL is correct
3. Test connection: `canvas_health_check`
4. Verify course ID exists: `canvas_list_courses`
5. Check API permissions (need teacher/admin role)
6. Review Canvas API rate limits (not exceeded)

#### Issue: Accessibility audit returns errors
**Symptoms**: Content fails WCAG checks

**Common Problems & Fixes**:
- **Missing alt text**: Add descriptive alt attributes to all images
- **Low color contrast**: Increase contrast to 4.5:1 minimum (use WebAIM checker)
- **Heading hierarchy skipped**: Use proper H1‚ÜíH2‚ÜíH3 progression
- **Non-descriptive links**: Change "click here" to descriptive text
- **Missing captions**: Add captions to all videos (use Canvas Studio)

#### Issue: Templates not loading
**Symptoms**: Template files produce errors

**Solutions**:
1. Check file path: `expansion-packs/bmad-education/templates/`
2. Verify YAML syntax (common issue: indentation)
3. Ensure file extension is `.yaml` (not `.yml`)
4. Review template examples in TEMPLATES_SUMMARY.md
5. Start with simplest template (learning-objectives-tmpl.yaml)

#### Issue: UDL application seems superficial
**Symptoms**: UDL suggestions are generic or checklist-like

**Solutions**:
1. Provide more context: grade level, subject, specific content
2. Share existing lesson/unit content for analysis
3. Request specific UDL principle focus (engagement, representation, or expression)
4. Ask for concrete Canvas implementation examples
5. Use *barrier-analysis first to identify specific obstacles

#### Issue: Assessment alignment incorrect
**Symptoms**: Assessment doesn't match learning objectives

**Solutions**:
1. Share learning objectives explicitly with Assessment Specialist
2. Request blueprint before item development
3. Use *analyze-objectives first to verify objective quality
4. Specify desired Bloom's and DOK distribution
5. Review assessment-validity.md for quality criteria

#### Issue: Workflow taking too long
**Symptoms**: Multi-step workflows feel inefficient

**Solutions**:
1. Use agent teams instead of sequential individual agents
2. Provide all context upfront (don't drip-feed information)
3. Use templates to structure inputs
4. Request *quick-version for faster iterations
5. Focus on critical quality elements first, polish later

#### Issue: Canvas course structure confusing
**Symptoms**: Students can't navigate course easily

**Solutions**:
1. EdTech Integrator: *canvas-optimize for structure review
2. Simplify module organization (fewer, larger modules)
3. Use consistent naming conventions
4. Add module overviews/instructions
5. Test in Canvas student view before publishing
6. Create course orientation module

#### Issue: Rubrics too complex
**Symptoms**: Rubrics overwhelming or hard to use

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce criteria (4-6 maximum for most tasks)
2. Limit performance levels (4 levels is standard)
3. Use simpler language in descriptors
4. Create student-friendly version
5. Provide exemplars for each level
6. Test inter-rater reliability with colleague
