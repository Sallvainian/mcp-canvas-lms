## Bloom's Taxonomy

### Overview
Bloom's Taxonomy (Revised 2001) provides a hierarchical classification of cognitive learning objectives. The revised version emphasizes active learning processes and moved "Creating" to the highest level.

### The Six Cognitive Levels

#### 1. Remember (Foundational)
**Definition**: Retrieve relevant knowledge from long-term memory

**Cognitive Processes**:
- Recognizing: Identify information from memory
- Recalling: Retrieve information from memory

**Action Verbs**: Define, describe, identify, label, list, match, name, recall, recognize, select

**Educational Use**: Foundation for all learning; necessary but not sufficient for deep understanding

**Canvas Implementation**: Quiz tools (multiple choice, matching, true/false)

#### 2. Understand
**Definition**: Construct meaning from instructional messages

**Cognitive Processes**:
- Interpreting, exemplifying, classifying, summarizing, inferring, comparing, explaining

**Action Verbs**: Classify, compare, contrast, explain, illustrate, interpret, paraphrase, summarize

**Educational Use**: First level of true comprehension; students can explain in their own words

**Canvas Implementation**: Discussion boards, short answer quizzes, summary assignments

#### 3. Apply
**Definition**: Use procedures in given situations

**Cognitive Processes**:
- Executing: Apply to familiar tasks
- Implementing: Apply to unfamiliar tasks

**Action Verbs**: Apply, build, execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate

## Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK)

### Overview
Webb's DOK framework measures cognitive complexity and rigor, focusing on the depth of thinking required rather than difficulty. It complements Bloom's by emphasizing the complexity and context of tasks.

### The Four DOK Levels

#### DOK Level 1: Recall & Reproduction
**Characteristics**:
- Basic recall of facts, terms, definitions
- Simple procedures with one step
- Well-defined, routine tasks

**Examples**:
- List the steps of photosynthesis

- Calculate 15 + 27
- Identify the parts of a cell

**Assessment Types**: Multiple choice, matching, basic calculations, vocabulary tests

**Time Required**: Seconds to minutes

**Canvas Tools**: Quiz tools, flashcard integrations, simple fill-in-blank

#### DOK Level 2: Skills & Concepts
**Characteristics**:
- Use of information and conceptual knowledge
- Multiple steps with some decision-making
- Requires engagement with concepts beyond recall

**Examples**:
- Explain the relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration
- Compare two forms of government
- Solve multi-step word problems
- Classify organisms using characteristics

**Assessment Types**: Short constructed responses, concept mapping, problem-solving sets

**Time Required**: Minutes to one class period

**Canvas Tools**: Short answer quizzes, discussion boards, concept map assignments

#### DOK Level 3: Strategic Thinking
**Characteristics**:
- Reasoning, planning, using evidence
- Abstract, complex thinking
- Multiple possible approaches or solutions
- Requires supporting claims with evidence

**Examples**:
- Design an experiment to test a hypothesis

### DOK vs. Bloom's: Key Differences

**Bloom's Taxonomy**:
- Focuses on the **type** of cognitive process
- Verb-based classification
- Hierarchical levels of thinking

**Webb's DOK**:
- Focuses on **complexity** and **context** of cognitive demand
- Context-dependent (same verb can be different DOK levels)
- Measures depth of understanding required

**Integration Example**:
- "Analyze" (Bloom's) can be DOK 2 (compare simple texts) or DOK 3 (analyze complex arguments with evidence)
- The verb doesn't determine DOK; the context and complexity do

## Understanding by Design (UbD) / Backward Design

### Overview
Developed by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe, Understanding by Design (UbD) is a framework for curriculum planning that begins with the end in mind. Rather than starting with activities or content, UbD starts with desired learning outcomes.

### Core Philosophy

**"Begin with the End in Mind"**
- Traditional design: Content → Activities → Assessment (often misaligned)
- Backward design: Outcomes → Assessment → Activities (ensures alignment)

**Understanding vs. Coverage**
- Goal is deep, transferable understanding, not superficial content coverage
- Focus on "enduring understandings" that persist beyond the unit/course

### The Three Stages

#### Stage 1: Identify Desired Results
**Purpose**: Clarify learning priorities and establish goals

**Components**:

1. **Established Goals**
   - Standards, curriculum expectations, course objectives
   - What students should know and be able to do

2. **Enduring Understandings**
   - Big ideas with lasting value beyond the classroom
   - Transferable concepts that organize discrete facts
   - Framed as full-sentence generalizations
   - Example: "Writers make deliberate choices to achieve specific effects on readers" (not just "literary devices")

3. **Essential Questions**
   - Open-ended, thought-provoking questions without simple answers
   - Provoke genuine inquiry and sustained engagement
   - Recur throughout unit to deepen understanding
   - Example: "How do we know what to believe?" vs. "What is the scientific method?"

4. **Knowledge & Skills**
   - What students will know (facts, concepts, principles)
   - What students will be able to do (skills, processes)
   - Necessary for achieving understandings

**Canvas Implementation**:
- Create course-level outcomes for enduring understandings
- Use module introductions to present essential questions
- Map specific knowledge/skills to individual assignments

#### Stage 2: Determine Acceptable Evidence
**Purpose**: Identify how students will demonstrate understanding

**Components**:

1. **Performance Tasks (Transfer Tasks)**
   - Authentic, real-world applications of learning
   - Require transfer to new situations
   - Complex, open-ended problems
   - Example: Design public health campaign rather than define "epidemiology"

2. **Other Evidence**
   - Quizzes, tests, observations
   - Academic prompts
   - Student self-assessment
   - Provide triangulation with performance tasks

3. **Evaluative Criteria**
   - Clear rubrics aligned to desired understandings
   - Success criteria visible to students from the start
   - Standards for quality performance

**Canvas Implementation**:
- Create rubrics aligned to enduring understandings
- Use assignment tool for performance tasks with detailed instructions
- Implement peer review for self-assessment
- Track outcomes mastery through Canvas analytics

#### Stage 3: Plan Learning Experiences and Instruction
**Purpose**: Design learning activities to achieve desired results with evidence in mind

**WHERETO Framework**:

**W** - **Where & Why**
- Help students understand the learning goals and their importance
- Clarify expectations and performance criteria
- Canvas: Use module overviews, assignment instructions with rubrics

**E** - **Evaluate**
- Formally assess student understanding
- Use performance tasks and other evidence from Stage 2
- Canvas: Graded assignments, quizzes, performance tasks

**T** - **Tailor**
- Differentiate to address learner variance
- Provide multiple pathways and options
- Canvas: Choice boards, tiered assignments, flexible deadlines

**O** - **Organize**
- Sequence learning for optimal understanding
- Move from simple to complex, concrete to abstract
- Canvas: Logical module progression, prerequisite settings

### Key Quality Indicators

**Stage 1 Quality**:
- Enduring understandings are conceptual, not just facts
- Essential questions are genuinely provocative and open-ended
- Goals focus on transfer, not just acquisition

**Stage 2 Quality**:
- Performance tasks require genuine transfer to new contexts

## Differentiation Strategies

### Overview
Differentiation is a philosophy and instructional approach that proactively plans varied approaches to content, process, and product to respond to learner readiness, interest, and learning profile.

**Core Premise**: One size does NOT fit all. Effective instruction meets students where they are and supports growth.

### Tomlinson's Framework

Differentiation can occur across three elements:

#### 1. Differentiated Content (The WHAT)
**Definition**: What students need to learn or how they access information

**Strategies**:

**By Readiness**:
- Tiered resources (same concept, varied complexity)
- Compacted curriculum for advanced learners
- Supplemental support materials for struggling learners

**By Interest**:
- Student choice in topics within unit parameters
- Multiple text options on same theme
- Interest-based research questions

**By Learning Profile**:
- Multiple modalities (text, video, audio, kinesthetic)
- Varied presentation formats
- Cultural relevance considerations

**Canvas Implementation**:
- Modules with tiered resource options
- Conditional release based on pre-assessment
- Choice boards embedded in pages
- Multiple resource formats provided

#### 2. Differentiated Process (The HOW)
**Definition**: How students make sense of or come to understand content

**Strategies**:

**By Readiness**:
- Varied scaffolding levels
- Flexible pacing
- Tiered activities (all students reach same goal, varied support)
- Learning contracts

**By Interest**:
- Student-selected projects within parameters
- Interest-based groupings
- Choice in learning activities

**By Learning Profile**:
- Multiple activity formats (individual, pair, group)
- Varied thinking tools (graphic organizers, concept maps)
- Learning style accommodations

**Canvas Implementation**:
- Multiple pathways through module content
- Self-paced modules with checkpoints
- Discussion groups organized by interest
- Assignment choice boards
- Mastery-based progression

#### 3. Differentiated Product (The OUTPUT)
**Definition**: How students demonstrate what they have learned

**Strategies**:

**By Readiness**:
- Tiered assessments (all measure same objectives, varied complexity)
- Varied scaffolding for final products
- Graduated rubrics with extension opportunities

**By Interest**:
- Choice in final product format
- Student-designed projects within parameters
- Multiple demonstration options

**By Learning Profile**:
- Multiple intelligence options (linguistic, spatial, kinesthetic, etc.)
- Varied output modalities (written, visual, oral, digital)
- Group vs. individual options

**Canvas Implementation**:
- Assignment instructions with multiple product options
- Common rubric applied across all product types
- Student selection of demonstration format
- Portfolio options for cumulative demonstration

### Differentiation vs. Individualization vs. Personalization

**Differentiation**:
- Teacher proactively plans varied approaches
- Same learning goals, varied paths
- Teacher-directed with student input

**Individualization**:
- Instruction paced to individual learner needs
- Same learning goals, customized pace
- Often technology-supported

**Personalization**:
- Student co-designs learning experience
- Student voice and choice in goals and path
- Student-driven with teacher as facilitator

**Canvas Supports All Three**:
- Differentiation: Multiple pathways, tiered resources
- Individualization: Mastery paths, adaptive learning tools
- Personalization: Student choice assignments, learning contracts

### Practical Differentiation Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Tiered Assignments
**Same destination, varied routes based on readiness**

**Example**: Photosynthesis Unit
- **Foundation Tier**: Create labeled diagram, explain process step-by-step
- **Core Tier**: Explain relationship to cellular respiration, solve application problems
- **Advanced Tier**: Design experiment, analyze C3/C4/CAM photosynthesis

All tiers assessed on accuracy, depth, and communication.

**Canvas Implementation**: Single assignment with three option descriptions, student self-selects tier

#### Strategy 2: Learning Contracts
**Negotiated agreement between teacher and student on goals, methods, assessment**

**Components**:
- Required work (all students)
- Optional extensions (student interest)
- Timeline and checkpoints
- Assessment criteria

**Canvas Implementation**: Contract template in Pages, student submits completed contract, teacher approves via grading

#### Strategy 3: Choice Boards (Tic-Tac-Toe / Menu)
**Student selects activities from options grid**

**Structure**:
- 9-square grid (tic-tac-toe) or menu format
- Must complete row/column or minimum number
- Options vary by product type, learning style, interest
- All options align to same learning objectives

**Canvas Implementation**: Page with embedded choice board, assignment submission includes which choices completed

#### Strategy 4: Flexible Grouping
**Groups change based on task, readiness, interest**

**Types**:
- Readiness groups: Work on appropriately challenging tasks
- Interest groups: Explore topics of passion
- Learning profile groups: Match activity to strengths
- Random/heterogeneous: Diverse perspectives and peer learning

**Canvas Implementation**: Group sets can be changed per activity, discussion groups organized flexibly

#### Strategy 5: Compacting
**Eliminate repetition for students who demonstrate mastery**

**Process**:
1. Pre-assess to identify mastery
2. Streamline curriculum for mastered content
3. Provide enrichment or acceleration instead

**Canvas Implementation**: Pre-assessment quiz exempts from certain modules, alternative enrichment module available

- Writing samples

**Canvas Tools**: Surveys, ungraded quizzes, self-assessment forms

### Assessment Validity

**Validity**: Does the assessment measure what it's supposed to measure?

#### Types of Validity

**1. Content Validity**
- Does assessment represent full range of content taught?
- Are all learning objectives measured?
- Is content balanced appropriately?

**Quality Check**:
- Create test blueprint mapping items to objectives
- Ensure coverage of all critical content
- Balance representation by importance

**Canvas Support**: Outcome alignment reports show coverage

**2. Construct Validity**
- Does assessment measure the intended construct (concept/skill)?
- Are items appropriate for measuring construct?
- Do results align with theoretical understanding?

**Quality Check**:
- Align items to cognitive level (Bloom's, DOK)
- Ensure tasks genuinely require intended thinking
- Review for confounding factors (reading level, prior knowledge)

**Canvas Support**: Rubrics can articulate construct dimensions

**3. Criterion Validity**
- Do results correlate with external criteria?
- Predictive: Do scores predict future performance?
- Concurrent: Do scores align with other measures?

**Quality Check**:
- Compare to other established assessments
- Track student performance over time
- Validate with external benchmarks

**Canvas Support**: Analytics tracking student performance patterns

**4. Face Validity**
- Does assessment appear to measure what it claims?
- Do stakeholders (students, parents, teachers) perceive it as valid?

**Quality Check**:
- Clear connection between assessment and learning objectives
- Transparent criteria and expectations
- Authentic, meaningful tasks

**Canvas Support**: Transparent rubrics and detailed instructions

### Assessment Reliability

**Reliability**: Does the assessment produce consistent results?

**Factors Affecting Reliability**:

## Framework Integration Patterns

### How Frameworks Work Together

The power of the BMAD Education Pack comes from intelligent integration of these frameworks, not isolated application. Here's how they combine:

### Integration Pattern 1: Backward Design + Bloom's + DOK

**Stage 1: Identify Desired Results**
- Use **Bloom's** to categorize knowledge/skills by cognitive process
- Use **DOK** to ensure appropriate complexity for grade level
- Design objectives targeting range of cognitive levels

**Stage 2: Determine Evidence**
- **Bloom's** guides assessment type selection (apply → problem sets, evaluate → critique)
- **DOK** ensures tasks match intended complexity (DOK 3 for strategic thinking)
- Performance tasks require DOK 3-4 complexity

**Stage 3: Plan Learning**
- Activities scaffold from lower to higher Bloom's levels
- Gradual release moves from DOK 1-2 to 3-4
- Instruction directly builds skills assessed in Stage 2

**Example**:
```
Stage 1: Students will evaluate the effectiveness of New Deal programs (Bloom's: Evaluate, DOK 3)
Stage 2: Performance task - Analyze historical evidence to argue which programs had greatest impact
Stage 3: Activities progress:
  - Remember: Identify New Deal programs (Bloom's 1, DOK 1)
  - Understand: Explain goals of each program (Bloom's 2, DOK 2)
  - Apply: Use economic data to assess outcomes (Bloom's 3, DOK 2)
  - Analyze: Compare effectiveness across programs (Bloom's 4, DOK 3)
  - Evaluate: Synthesize evidence into argument (Bloom's 5, DOK 3)
```

### Integration Pattern 2: UDL + Differentiation + Backward Design

**Stage 1 (Backward Design) with UDL**:
- Learning objectives are clear and accessible to all learners

## Troubleshooting

### Common Questions

**Q: "When should I use Bloom's vs. DOK?"**
A: Use both together. Bloom's categorizes the cognitive process (what thinking), DOK measures complexity (how deep). A task can be "Analyze" (Bloom's) but DOK 2 (simple comparison) or DOK 3 (complex synthesis). Use Bloom's for objective writing, DOK for ensuring appropriate rigor.

**Q: "Is backward design really necessary for every lesson?"**
A: Full UbD template isn't required for every lesson, but the mindset is: always start with what students should understand, determine how you'll know, then plan activities. For daily lessons, simplified version works. For units, full backward design ensures alignment.

**Q: "How much differentiation is realistic?"**
A: Start with one element: content, process, OR product. Don't try to differentiate everything at once. Most sustainable: offer product choice (UDL) or tiered assignments by readiness. Build gradually.

**Q: "Do all Gagné events need to be in every lesson?"**
A: No. Gagné provides comprehensive framework, but not every lesson needs all nine events. Short lessons might combine events. Extended units spread them across days. Use as design checklist, not rigid template.

**Q: "How do I align to standards without just 'teaching to the test'?"**
A: Standards are learning targets, not test items. Use backward design: identify standards (Stage 1), design authentic assessments measuring those standards (Stage 2), then create engaging learning experiences (Stage 3). Standards guide direction; instruction creates meaning.
