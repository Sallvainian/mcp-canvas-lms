## Common Quick Start Questions

### Q: "Can I use this without Canvas?"
**A**: Absolutely! Agents generate educational content in standard formats (YAML, Markdown). You can:
- Use outputs for lesson planning
- Adapt for any LMS (Moodle, Blackboard, Google Classroom)
- Print for traditional planning
- Import Canvas-formatted content later when ready

### Q: "Do I need to know educational frameworks?"
**A**: No! Agents guide you through frameworks with:
- Plain-language explanations
- Numbered options for selection
- Templates that structure your thinking
- Automatic alignment to standards

You'll learn frameworks by using them.

### Q: "How long does a full course take?"
**A**: Depends on scope:
- **Single unit** (2-3 weeks): 30-60 minutes with unit-design-backward workflow
- **Semester course** (15 weeks): 2-3 hours with course-design-full workflow
- **Full year** (36 weeks): 4-6 hours with systematic planning

Agents dramatically reduce planning time while improving quality.

### Q: "Can I customize agent outputs?"
**A**: Yes! Agents provide:
- YAML templates you can edit
- Markdown documents you can revise
- Canvas-ready formats you can adjust
- "doc-out" command to save work in progress

All outputs are starting points, not final products.

### Q: "What if I make a mistake?"
**A**: No problem:
- Agents guide with numbered options (no wrong choices)
- You can restart commands anytime
- Canvas changes are reversible
- Templates can be regenerated

Learning by doing is encouraged!

## Troubleshooting Quick Start

### Issue: Agent won't activate
**Solution**: Verify path and use exact agent name:
```
/load expansion-packs/bmad-education/agents/curriculum-architect.md
```

### Issue: Commands not working
**Solution**: Commands require `*` prefix:
```
*create-objectives  ‚úÖ Correct
create-objectives   ‚ùå Incorrect
```

### Issue: Canvas tools failing
**Solution**:
1. Check API token is set: `echo $CANVAS_API_TOKEN`
2. Verify course ID is correct
3. Run `canvas_health_check()` to test connection

### Issue: Don't understand agent questions
**Solution**: Ask agent for clarification:
```
User: Can you explain what you mean by "standards framework"?

Dr. Vasquez: Standards frameworks are official sets of learning expectations.
Common examples:
1. Common Core (ELA and Math)
2. NGSS (Science)
3. NCSS (Social Studies)
4. ISTE (Technology)

Which subject are you teaching? I'll suggest the appropriate framework.
```
