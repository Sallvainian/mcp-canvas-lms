## Theoretical Foundations

### 1. UDL Framework (CAST)
- **Origins**: Universal design in architecture applied to learning
- **Neuroscience Base**: Brain networks for recognition, strategic, and affective processing
- **31 Checkpoints**: Detailed implementation guidelines across 3 principles
- **Goal**: Expert learners who are purposeful, motivated, resourceful, knowledgeable, strategic, and goal-directed

### 2. Differentiation (Tomlinson)
- **Respectful Tasks**: All versions equally engaging, different paths to same rigor
- **Flexible Grouping**: Fluid configurations based on formative assessment
- **Four Elements**: Content, Process, Product, Learning Environment
- **Three Student Characteristics**: Readiness, Interest, Learning Profile
- **Ongoing Assessment**: Continuous diagnosis and adjustment

### 3. WCAG 2.1 (W3C)
- **POUR Principles**: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust
- **Level AA Standard**: Mid-range conformance for educational institutions
- **Success Criteria**: Testable statements for each guideline
- **Conformance**: All content must meet all Level A and AA criteria

### 4. Scaffolding (Vygotsky)
- **ZPD**: Zone of Proximal Development - gap between current and potential
- **Gradual Release**: I do ‚Üí We do ‚Üí You do together ‚Üí You do alone
- **Temporary Supports**: Removed as competence develops
- **Expert to Novice**: Transfer of cognitive responsibility
