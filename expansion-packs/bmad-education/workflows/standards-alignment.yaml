success_criteria:
  - All applicable standards identified and prioritized
  - 100% of priority standards addressed in outcomes
  - All assessments aligned with appropriate DOK levels
  - Instruction provides adequate coverage of all standards
  - Standards visible and transparent to students
  - Canvas alignment documentation complete
  - Stakeholder reports demonstrate comprehensive alignment
  - Vertical alignment with prior/next grade levels verified

common_pitfalls:
  - Trying to address too many standards (spread too thin)
  - Superficial alignment (listing standards without deep instruction)
  - Mismatching DOK levels (assessing lower than standard requires)
  - Over-emphasizing supporting standards at expense of priority standards
  - Using jargon-heavy standard language without student-friendly translation
  - Not verifying vertical alignment (gaps or redundancy across grades)
  - Treating alignment as paperwork exercise rather than instructional improvement
  - Forgetting to communicate alignment clearly to students and parents
