  - Creating assessments that don't align with learning outcomes
  - Overlooking accessibility until final phase (integrate from start)
  - Building Canvas course before content is finalized
  - Insufficient formative assessment throughout units
  - Vague or unmeasurable learning outcomes
  - Skipping quality review phase due to time pressure
  - Not testing student experience before launch
