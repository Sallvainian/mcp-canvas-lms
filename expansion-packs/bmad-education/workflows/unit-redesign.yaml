common_pitfalls:
  - Making superficial changes without addressing core design issues
  - Focusing only on content updates without assessment redesign
  - Adding activities without removing outdated ones (bloat)
  - Overlooking accessibility in rush to update content
  - Not preserving successful elements from original unit
  - Insufficient testing of student experience before launch
  - Breaking existing Canvas links and references
  - Not communicating changes clearly to students
