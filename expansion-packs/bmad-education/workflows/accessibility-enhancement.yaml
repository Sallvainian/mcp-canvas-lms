success_criteria:

  - UDL principles integrated with multiple pathways evident
  - Canvas accessibility checker shows no errors
  - Assistive technology testing successful
  - Student experience testing shows improved usability
  - Accessibility documentation complete and published

common_pitfalls:
  - Focusing only on WCAG compliance without UDL integration
  - Automating accessibility (bad alt text, auto-captions without review)
  - Not testing with actual assistive technologies
  - Overwhelming students with too many choices (choice paralysis)
  - Forgetting to maintain accessibility with new content
  - Not involving students with disabilities in testing
  - Treating accessibility as one-time fix rather than ongoing practice
  - Overlooking cognitive accessibility (plain language, organization)
