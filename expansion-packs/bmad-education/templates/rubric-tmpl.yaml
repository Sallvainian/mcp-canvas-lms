  Tips for Effective Rubric Use:
  - Share rubric with students before they begin work
  - Use rubric for formative feedback during the process
  - Provide anchor examples for each performance level
  - Involve students in understanding and even creating criteria
  - Review and refine rubric based on actual student work
