notes: |
  Additional implementation notes, contextual information, or reminders.

  Key UbD Principles:
  - Begin with the end in mind (Stage 1)
  - Determine acceptable evidence before planning instruction (Stage 2)
  - Design learning experiences that lead to desired results (Stage 3)
  - Focus on transfer, meaning, and acquisition
  - Make thinking visible throughout
