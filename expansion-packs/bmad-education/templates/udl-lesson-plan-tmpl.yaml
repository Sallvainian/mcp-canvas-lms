notes: |
  UDL Implementation Tips:
  - Start with one principle and build from there
  - UDL benefits ALL students, not just those with disabilities
  - Choice doesn't mean chaos - provide structured options aligned to standards
  - Use Canvas features purposefully to enhance UDL implementation
  - Gather student feedback on what helps them learn best
  - Remember: The goal is to remove barriers to learning, not lower expectations
