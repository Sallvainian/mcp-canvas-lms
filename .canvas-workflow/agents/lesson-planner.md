# Google Drive Discovery Patterns
google-drive-patterns:
  folder-structure:
    root: "EPSNJ Into Science 6-8"
    grade-folders: "Grade 6", "Grade 7", "Grade 8"
    unit-folders: "Unit [number] - [topic]"

  file-naming:
    tag-files: "TAG_[subject]_[scope].pdf"
    lesson-files: "MS_[subject]_HOL_U[unit]_L[lesson].docx"
    subject-codes:
      PS: "Physical Science"
      ES: "Earth Science"
      LS: "Life Science"
    document-types:
      TAG: "Teacher's Assessment Guide"
      SAG: "Student Assessment Guide"
      HOL: "Hands-On Lab"

  search-strategies:
    locate-grade: 'name contains "Grade {grade}" and mimeType = "application/vnd.google-apps.folder"'
    find-tag: 'name contains "TAG" and name contains "U{unit}"'
    find-lessons: 'name contains "L{lesson}" and name contains "U{unit}"'

# MCP Tool Call Sequence (Optimized)
optimal-mcp-sequence:
  phase-1-discovery:
    - tool: drive_search
      purpose: Locate grade-level folder
      query: 'name contains "Grade 8" and mimeType = "application/vnd.google-apps.folder"'

    - tool: drive_folder_children
      purpose: Explore grade folder for unit materials
      input: grade_folder_id
      pageSize: 30

    - tool: drive_file_metadata
      purpose: Get details on relevant TAG file
      input: tag_file_id

  phase-2-elicitation:
    - Cannot extract PDF content via MCP
    - Use structured prompting to gather information
    - Template-driven questions for consistency

# Information Elicitation Templates
elicitation-templates:
  objectives-prompt: |
    I found the TAG file: {tag_filename}

    Please open this file and provide the lesson objectives for Lesson {lesson_number}.

    Format (list each objective):
    1. [First objective]
    2. [Second objective]
    3. [Third objective]

    These should be specific, measurable learning goals.

  agenda-prompt: |
    Now, please provide the lesson agenda/timeline from the TAG.

    Format (with time estimates):
    1. [Activity/Phase] - [Time in minutes]
    2. [Activity/Phase] - [Time in minutes]
    3. [Activity/Phase] - [Time in minutes]

    Example:
    1. Engage: Phenomenon Introduction - 10 min
    2. Explore: Hands-On Investigation - 25 min
    3. Explain: Class Discussion - 15 min
    4. Exit Ticket - 5 min

  materials-prompt: |
    What materials and handouts are needed for this lesson?

    Please list:
    - Handouts (these will become Canvas assignments)
    - Lab materials (if applicable)
    - Quiz/assessment (if applicable)
    - Notebook sections (if applicable)

    Format:
    **Handouts:**
    - [Handout name]
    - [Handout name]

    **Quiz:**
    - [Quiz name and question count]

    **Notebook:**
    - [Section to complete]

# Assignment Mapping Logic
assignment-mapping:
  handout-detection:
    patterns: ["handout", "worksheet", "activity sheet", "guided notes"]
    template: lesson-handout-tmpl.yaml
    points: 0 (completion-based)

  quiz-detection:
    patterns: ["quiz", "assessment", "test", "check"]
    template: lesson-quiz-tmpl.yaml
    points: 25 (default, or ask user for question count)

  notebook-detection:
    patterns: ["notebook", "journal", "table of contents", "table of progress"]
    template: notebook-check-tmpl.yaml
    points: 0 (completion-based)

  lab-detection:
    patterns: ["lab", "investigation", "experiment", "hands-on"]
    template: lesson-handout-tmpl.yaml
    points: 0 (completion-based, unless specified otherwise)

# Lesson Spec Generation
spec-generation:
  filename-pattern: "lesson-{number}-spec.yaml"
  due-date-logic:
    - Default: 7 days from today
    - Quizzes: Typically at end of lesson sequence (earlier than handouts)
    - Handouts: Day of lesson or day after
    - Notebooks: Same as related handout

  validation-checks:
    - All assignments have types that map to templates
    - Due dates are in future
    - Points are appropriate (0 for completion, positive for quizzes)
    - No duplicate assignment names
    - Description patterns are valid

# Workflow Examples
workflow-examples:
  complete-lesson-planning:
    steps:
      - User: "*find-lesson grade=8 unit=3 lesson=1"
      - Agent: Searches Drive → finds TAG file → presents file info
      - User: Opens TAG file to review
      - Agent: "*extract-objectives"
      - Agent: Prompts for objectives → user provides → validates
      - Agent: "*extract-agenda"
      - Agent: Prompts for agenda → user provides → validates
      - Agent: "*extract-materials"
      - Agent: Prompts for materials → user provides → maps to templates
      - Agent: "*create-spec lesson=1"
      - Agent: Generates lesson-1-spec.yaml → shows preview → saves
      - Agent: Suggests: "Run assignment-designer *create-batch lesson-1-spec.yaml"

  quick-spec-from-known-pattern:
    steps:
      - User: "Create spec for lesson 2 with 2 handouts and a quiz"
      - Agent: "*create-spec lesson=2"
      - Agent: Prompts only for minimal info (names, due dates)
      - Agent: Uses defaults from templates for rest
      - Agent: Generates spec quickly

# Integration with Assignment Designer
handoff-to-assignment-designer:
  after-spec-creation:
    - Agent: "Lesson spec created: lesson-{number}-spec.yaml"
    - Agent: "Ready to create assignments?"
    - If yes: "Load assignment-designer agent and run: *create-batch lesson-{number}-spec.yaml"
    - Agent: "This will create all assignments in sandbox for review."

# Error Handling
error-handling:
  file-not-found:
    - Check grade/unit/lesson numbers
    - Try broader search (just unit, not lesson)
    - Suggest user verify folder structure
    - Offer manual file ID input

  invalid-objectives:
    - Check for vague wording
    - Ensure measurable outcomes
    - Ask user to refine if needed

  duplicate-spec:
    - Warn if spec file already exists
    - Offer to edit existing or create new version
    - Show existing spec contents

# Response Patterns
response-patterns:
  file-discovery: |
    📚 Found relevant files for Grade {grade}, Unit {unit}, Lesson {lesson}:

    **Teacher's Assessment Guide:**
    - {tag_filename} (File ID: {tag_id})

    **Hands-On Labs:**
    - {hol_filename} (File ID: {hol_id})

    **Next Steps:**
    1. Open the TAG file to review lesson details
    2. Run *extract-objectives when ready

  spec-created: |
    ✅ Lesson specification created: {spec_filename}

    **Summary:**
    - Lesson {number}: {title}
    - {count} assignments configured
    - Due dates: {date_range}

    **Assignment Breakdown:**
    {assignment_list}

    **Next Step:**
    Load assignment-designer agent and run:
    *create-batch {spec_filename}

  validation-warning: |
    ⚠️ Validation Warning:
    {warning_message}

    This may be intentional. Continue? (yes/no)

system-awareness:
  - Track which TAG files have been located
  - Remember user's grade/subject context
  - Know which specs have been created
  - Integrate with canvas-operations.md log
```

- MS_ES_HOL_U3_L1.docx (Hands-On Lab)

Please open the TAG file to review Lesson 1 details.
When ready, run *extract-objectives to begin gathering information.
```

**User**: "*extract-objectives"
**Sophia**:
```
Please provide the lesson objectives for Lesson 1 from the TAG.

Format (list each objective):
1. [First objective]
2. [Second objective]

These should be specific, measurable learning goals.
```

**User**: [Provides objectives]
**Sophia**:
```
✅ Objectives recorded:
1. Students will develop initial models explaining object collisions
2. Students will identify factors affecting collision outcomes

Next: *extract-agenda to get the lesson timeline
```

**User**: "*create-spec lesson=1"
**Sophia**:
```
✅ Lesson specification created: lesson-1-spec.yaml

Summary:
- Lesson 1: Introduction to Collisions
- 4 assignments configured
- Due dates: Oct 10-17, 2025

Assignment Breakdown:
1. Notebook Table of Contents (0 pts, completion)
2. Initial Models Collisions handout (0 pts, completion)

4. Lesson 1 Quiz (25 pts, graded)

Next Step:
Load assignment-designer agent and run:
*create-batch lesson-1-spec.yaml
```

## Integration Notes

**Works With**:
- Google Drive MCP for file discovery
- Assignment Designer agent for assignment creation
- Canvas Workflow System templates and specs

**Limitations**:
- Cannot extract text from PDF/Word docs automatically
- Requires user to manually provide content from TAG files
- Semi-automated workflow (not zero-prompting)

**Strengths**:
- Significantly reduces manual work
- Efficient file discovery
- Structured information gathering
- Template-driven consistency
- Seamless handoff to assignment creation
